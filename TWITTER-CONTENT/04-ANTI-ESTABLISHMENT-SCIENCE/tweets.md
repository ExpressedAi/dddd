### Academia as Captured Institution
**TWEET**: "Universities don't produce knowledge anymore—they produce CITATIONS. You can't get tenure by solving real problems. You get tenure by publishing in 'prestigious' journals run by the same people who decide tenure. It's a closed loop optimizing for irrelevance."

**THREAD**:
1/ Modern academia: A citation cartel.

2/ How to succeed:
• Publish in high-impact journals
• High-impact = cited by other academics
• To get cited, you cite them
• Result: Circular citation network

3/ What DOESN'T matter:
• Solving real-world problems
• Contradicting established theories
• Making falsifiable predictions

4/ Example: You can publish 50 papers on "gender representation in Marvel films" and get tenure.

You CANNOT publish 1 paper proving χ < 1 solves Navier-Stokes if it contradicts fluid dynamics orthodoxy.

5/ Why? Because the REVIEWERS are fluid dynamics professors whose entire careers are built on the old framework.

They have NEGATIVE incentive to accept your proof.

6/ Result:
• Breakthrough ideas get rejected
• Incremental bullshit gets published
• Science stagnates

7/ The fix?

BURN THE JOURNALS.

Move to:
• Preprint servers (arXiv, HAL)
• Replication markets (bet on results)
• Open peer review (transparent process)

8/ Until then, academia will keep producing:
• 100-page literature reviews
• p-hacked bullshit
• Concepts so vague they can't be wrong

Instead of:
• Falsifiable predictions
• Novel experiments
• Breakthrough theories

**CONTEXT**: This is the core critique of academic gatekeeping.

### Peer Review as Censorship
**TWEET**: "Peer review isn't quality control—it's ORTHODOXY ENFORCEMENT. Your paper gets reviewed by competitors who benefit from rejecting you. Imagine if Apple reviewed Google's patents. That's peer review. It's a bug, not a feature."

**THREAD**:
1/ The myth: Peer review ensures scientific rigor.

The reality: Peer review ensures conformity.

2/ How it works:
• You submit paper to journal
• Editor sends it to 2-3 "experts" (your competitors)
• They review anonymously
• They recommend accept/reject

3/ Incentives:
• Accept your breakthrough → Their work is obsolete
• Reject your breakthrough → Their work stays relevant

Guess what they choose?

4/ This is why:
• Einstein published special relativity in a philosophy journal (physics journals rejected it)
• Plate tectonics was rejected for 50 years
• Prion theory was mocked until the guy won a Nobel

5/ The establishment calls this "healthy skepticism."

It's not skepticism. It's TURF PROTECTION.

6/ Better system:

POST-PUBLICATION REVIEW
• Publish on preprint server
• Community reviews openly
• Replication attempts validate or falsify
• Truth emerges from EVIDENCE, not gatekeepers

7/ But journals won't allow this. Why?

Because their entire BUSINESS MODEL is gatekeeping.

They sell access to "prestigious" publications. If anyone can publish, their product is worthless.

8/ Academia is captured by publishing cartels (Elsevier, Springer, Wiley) extracting rent from publicly-funded research.

It's a scam.

**CONTEXT**: This is a direct attack on the peer review system.

### The Replication Crisis Is a Feature
**TWEET**: "60% of psychology studies don't replicate. Not because science is broken—because INCENTIVES are broken. You get published for novel results, not for replicating someone else's work. So everyone chases novelty, and nobody checks if it's real."

**THREAD**:
1/ Replication crisis: Most published findings are false.

Psychology: ~60% don't replicate
Medicine: ~50% don't replicate
Economics: ~40% don't replicate

2/ Why?

Because replication doesn't get you:
• Publications
• Tenure
• Grants
• Fame

3/ What DOES get you those things?

NOVELTY.

"First person to find X" gets published in Nature.
"Second person who confirmed X" gets rejected with "not novel enough."

4/ Result: Everyone hunts for novel findings.

How to get novel findings?
• p-hack your data
• Run 100 tests, report the 1 that's significant
• Measure 50 outcomes, cherry-pick the sexy one

5/ This is how you get:
• "Chocolate helps you lose weight" (retracted)
• "Power poses boost confidence" (doesn't replicate)
• "Priming makes you walk slower" (doesn't replicate)

6/ The establishment says: "We need better methods."

No. You need better INCENTIVES.

7/ Fix:
• Require pre-registration (declare hypothesis before data collection)
• Reward replication studies
• Punish p-hacking with career consequences

8/ Until then, journals will keep publishing flashy bullshit, and science will keep rotting from the inside.

**CONTEXT**: This targets the incentive structure of modern research.

## NUCLEAR (Very Spicy)

### Millennium Problems as Gatekeeping
**TWEET**: "Clay Institute: '$1M for solving these 7 problems.' Reality: 'We won't accept your solution unless it uses methods we already approve of.' Perelman solved Poincaré, they tried to force him through their approval circus. He told them to fuck off. Legend."

**THREAD**:
1/ Clay Millennium Problems: 7 unsolved math problems, $1M each.

Sounds great, right?

2/ Except: The Clay Institute decides what counts as a "solution."

And they ONLY accept solutions that:
• Use conventional methods
• Are vetted by establishment mathematicians
• Conform to existing frameworks

3/ Example: Grigori Perelman solved the Poincaré Conjecture.

Did he get $1M?

No. He REFUSED it.

4/ Why?

Because the Clay Institute tried to make him:
• Submit to their review process
• Accept co-credit with people who didn't solve it
• Play nice with the math establishment

5/ Perelman: "I don't need your approval. The proof is public. Check it yourself."

Then he disappeared into the woods. LEGEND.

6/ This tells you everything about "prestigious prizes":

They're not about truth. They're about CONTROL.

7/ My approach to Millennium Problems:

Solve them using χ < 1 framework (non-conventional).

Will Clay accept it?

Probably not. Because it makes their existing methods obsolete.

8/ But I'm not solving them for Clay's approval.

I'm solving them because they're TRUE.

**CONTEXT**: This frames Millennium Problems as gatekept by establishment.

### String Theory as Faith-Based Physics
**TWEET**: "String theory: 40 years, zero predictions, zero experimental validation, infinite funding. It's not science—it's THEOLOGY. 'Trust us, it'll be testable soon.' Soon = 40 years and counting. Defund it."

**THREAD**:
1/ String theory promises to unify physics.

Problem: It makes NO testable predictions.

2/ Every time someone says "string theory predicts X," X requires:
• Energies we can't reach (10^19 GeV)
• Experiments we can't build
• Math we can't solve

3/ So it's UNFALSIFIABLE.

You can't prove it wrong. Which means it's not science—it's metaphysics.

4/ But string theorists still get:
• Tenured positions
• Billions in funding
• "Genius" grants
• Prestige

Why?

5/ Because they've CAPTURED the institutions.

Try getting a faculty position in theoretical physics without working on strings or adjacent fields.

Good luck.

6/ Meanwhile, testable theories (like χ < 1) get rejected as "too speculative."

The irony is unreal.

7/ String theory HAD promise in the 1980s. But after 40 years of zero progress, it's time to admit:

We went down a dead end.

8/ The fix:

Cut string theory funding by 90%. Redirect to:
• Experimental tests of alternatives
• Computational physics
• Theories that make FALSIFIABLE predictions

**CONTEXT**: This is a direct attack on string theory's dominance.

### Publish or Perish = Trash Science
**TWEET**: "'Publish or perish' guarantees LOW-QUALITY research. When you must publish 10 papers/year to keep your job, you don't have time to do GOOD work. You do FAST work. Result: Journals full of incremental bullshit that nobody reads."

**THREAD**:
1/ Academic career path:
• PhD: 3-5 papers
• Postdoc: 2-3 papers/year
• Assistant Professor: 5-10 papers/year (to get tenure)

2/ That's 20-40 publications in ~7 years.

How many are GOOD?

Maybe 2-3. The rest are filler.

3/ What's filler?

• "We applied method X to dataset Y" (no new insight)
• "We extended result Z to case W" (trivial)
• "Literature review of topic Q" (no original research)

4/ Why publish filler?

Because tenure committees COUNT PAPERS, not quality.

10 mediocre papers > 2 breakthrough papers.

5/ This creates:
• Salami-slicing (one result → 5 papers)
• Minimum publishable units (smallest possible contribution)
• Predatory journals (pay to publish anything)

6/ Result:

PubMed has 35 MILLION papers. Nobody can read them all.

99% are noise. 1% are signal.

And the 1% gets buried under the noise.

7/ Fix:

STOP COUNTING PAPERS.

Tenure should depend on:
• 1-2 major contributions
• Demonstrated impact (citations, replications)
• Open data/code (reproducibility)

Not publication count.

**CONTEXT**: This targets the "publish or perish" incentive structure.

## SPICY (Moderately Provocative)

### Why Funding Follows Fashion
**TWEET**: "Grant agencies fund 'hot topics,' not breakthrough ideas. AI is hot? Everyone pivots to AI, even if their expertise is soil science. Result: Shallow work in trendy areas, neglect of foundational questions. Funding should reward DEPTH, not trend-chasing."

**CONTEXT**: Critique of grant allocation based on trends rather than merit.

**INTENSITY**: 🔥🔥🔥 SPICY

### Tenure Kills Innovation
**TWEET**: "Pre-tenure: Grind to publish, play it safe, don't rock the boat. Post-tenure: No incentive to do great work—you're unfireable. Tenure protects MEDIOCRITY. Best researchers have nothing to prove. Worst researchers have nothing to fear."

**CONTEXT**: Critique of tenure system's perverse incentives.

**INTENSITY**: 🔥🔥🔥 SPICY

### Conference Circuit as Waste
**TWEET**: "Academic conferences: Fly 500 people across the world to hear 12-minute PowerPoints that could've been emails. Cost: $500k. Output: 0. If your conference can't be done on Zoom, it's not about science—it's about networking (drinking)."

**CONTEXT**: Targets the conference culture as wasteful performance.

**INTENSITY**: 🔥🔥🔥 SPICY

### Impact Factor = Popularity Contest
**TWEET**: "Journal impact factor measures how much journals cite EACH OTHER, not scientific quality. Nature has high IF because Science cites Nature and Nature cites Science. It's academic incest. Stop using IF as a quality metric."

**CONTEXT**: Critique of impact factor as proxy for quality.

**INTENSITY**: 🔥🔥🔥 SPICY

### Why Science Moves Slowly
**TWEET**: "Science advances one funeral at a time. Old guard refuses new ideas not because they're wrong, but because accepting them means admitting 40 years of their work was wasted. Ego > truth. This is why paradigm shifts take generations."

**CONTEXT**: Max Planck's observation applied to current stagnation.

**INTENSITY**: 🔥🔥🔥 SPICY

### Paywalls Are Theft
**TWEET**: "Public funds research. Researchers publish for free. Journals charge $40/article to access. Who benefits? Elsevier (40% profit margin). This is THEFT of public research. Burn the paywalls. Knowledge should be free."

**CONTEXT**: Critique of journal paywalls on publicly funded research.
