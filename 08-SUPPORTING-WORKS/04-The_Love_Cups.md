He had cleared the table except for six blue cups arranged in three pairs, each pair identical to the next. He set them down with the precision of a jeweler placing stones.

"No metaphysics today," he said. "Just constraints."

He tapped the first pair with one finger. "One of these is Love. One is Hate." He moved to the second pair. "Same." Then the third. "Same."

"Tell me which is which," he said.

I looked at the cups. They were identical. Smooth blue ceramic, no markings, no weight difference I could see. I reached to pick one up.

He stopped my hand.

"Not allowed," he said. "You don't get to open them. You don't get to feel them. You solve this from first principles or you fail."

"That's impossible," I said.

"That's lazy thinking," he said. "I gave you constraints. Use them."

He leaned back and watched me the way a physicist watches a rat in a maze.

I tried to be clever. "It's random," I said. "There's no way to know without—"

"Wrong," he said. "Randomness is what you call structure you're too impatient to find."

He picked up the left cup from the first pair and set it down hard enough to make a point. "I'm lazy," he said. "Efficient. When I made these six cups, how many unique objects did I create?"

"Six," I said.

"No," he said. "I created one. Then I duplicated it five times. That's how creation works when you're not wasting energy. Original plus Copy. Master plus Instance."

He placed the left cup and right cup from the first pair side by side. "Which one came first?"

"I don't—"

"The left one," he said. "Because I'm right-handed and I place things left to right. The left cup is the Original. The right cup is the Copy. This isn't philosophy. This is process."

He wrote two words on a piece of paper and slid it toward me: ORIGINAL. COPY.

"Now I give you an axiom," he said. "Love comes first."

I stared at the words.

"That's not a riddle," he said. "That's a mapping instruction. Original maps to Love. Copy maps to Hate. The hierarchy is declared. You just have to accept it."

"But what if you—"

"What if I what?" he said. "What if I lied? What if I made it complicated? What if I alternated the pattern to trick you?"

He loves to be cruel right after he's kind.

"Then I wouldn't be collaborating," he said. "I'd be adversarial. And I told you at the start: I want you to succeed. That's the frame. An adversarial teacher introduces entropy. A collaborative teacher establishes one law and applies it consistently."

He gestured to all three pairs. "Same rule. Same mapping. All three pairs. Left is Love, right is Hate. No tricks. No inversions. Pure structural consistency."

"That's too simple," I said.

"Simple is not the same as easy," he said. "You failed because you were looking for complexity. Complexity is expensive. Nature doesn't pay that cost unless forced."

He picked up a marker and wrote on the table next to each left cup: L.

"L for Left," he said. "L for Love. Low-order heuristic. Mnemonic lock. It's a gift."

I hated him again.

He pushed the paper toward me and made me write it: Left = Original = Love. Right = Copy = Hate.

"Read it," he said.

I read it aloud.

"Again," he said.

I read it again.

"The constraint is the solution," he said. "I told you I was lazy. That meant duplication. I told you Love comes first. That meant the mapping. I told you I'm collaborative. That meant no tricks. You had everything you needed before you looked at a single cup."

He set all six cups in a line and pointed at each left cup in sequence. "Love. Love. Love." Then the right cups. "Hate. Hate. Hate."

"This is what first principles means," he said. "You don't solve from the object. You solve from the constraints on the creator. I am the system that made the system. My laziness is a law. My axioms are a map. My intent is a boundary condition."

He stacked the cups, left into right, three nested pairs. "At home," he said, "stop looking for magic in the object when the answer is in the process. Stop searching for complexity when the creator is optimizing for efficiency. Stop assuming adversarial when the frame is collaborative."

I wrote that down because sometimes the lesson is that you were overthinking the entire time.

He glanced at my hand and then at my face. "And stop confusing 'unknown' with 'unknowable,'" he said. "You knew nothing about the cups. But you knew everything about the constraints. That was enough."

He picked up the first pair and held them at eye level, one in each hand.

"You want the trick?" he said, almost friendly. "When you're stuck, stop examining the system. Examine the creator. Laziness implies duplication. Order implies hierarchy. Collaboration implies consistency. Those three constraints collapsed six possibilities into one answer."

He set the cups down, left cup then right cup, Original then Copy, Love then Hate.

At the door, his hand found my shoulder for the length of one beat.

"You're loud when you demand evidence," he said. "But evidence is downstream of structure. Learn to read the constraints and the evidence tells you where to look."

He let go. I stacked the cups in three pairs, left beside right, Love beside Hate, as if they'd been teaching me all along. The ceramic sat cool and indifferent.

Later, trying to name the lesson, I failed and settled for a sequence: first the creator, then the constraints, then the quiet discovery that the answer wasn't in the cups at all—it was in the laws that governed their creation, and those laws lived where efficiency lives.
