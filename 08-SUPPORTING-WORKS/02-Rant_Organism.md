I think about this all the time.
We have been subverted. We have been sold a bill of goods—a flimsy, rattling engine of democracy, scientific empiricism, and atheism, and we’ve been told to call it a chariot of the gods. And it’s a lie. A lazy, incoherent, and deeply cynical lie.
The truth is, it's easy to spot what's real. You just have to look at all the things they tell you to be afraid of. You just have to find the monsters they've painted on the edges of the map. Because that’s where the real territory begins.
And you find that with a few, simple, obvious modifications, those monsters become the most beautiful and superior systems imaginable.
Why are we so terrified of a monarchy? Look at nature. Look at your own body. Does your left foot get a vote on where you eat lunch? Does your right hand get to veto the brain? No. A healthy system has a single, coherent, and executive will. A great ship has one captain, not a committee. All a monarchy needs to be a thousand miles superior to the mess we have now is the one thing they tell you is impossible: to sever it from the rot of dynastic lineage.
And religion. Look at the strawman they build and then bravely knock down. They paint a picture of a bearded, petulant god in the sky granting wishes like a cosmic vending machine, and then they congratulate themselves for not believing in it. That is not religion. That is a cartoon. It is a fake argument designed to be red-teamed into oblivion, a distraction from the real, terrifying, and beautiful conversation about the nature of consciousness itself.
And the money games—the usury, the interest, the loans. It’s a cancer. A beautiful, simple rule for a healthy system is this: if you can’t afford it, you don’t fucking take it. And you certainly do not build a world on the foundation of taking money you have to pay back with more money, for no reason at all. Currency is supposed to be blood. It is supposed to flow. When it accumulates in one place, when it stagnates and clots, the body sickens. That is not capitalism; it is a tumor.
The funniest part of our democracy? We have managed to create the worst of both worlds. We have the chaotic, incoherent noise of mob rule, disguised as liberty, and we still have the dynastic lineage of political families and inherited power. It is a beautiful, tragic, and hilarious failure of architectural design.
If the world could see through the lens of Delta, just for a moment, they would realize that "good" and "evil" are objectively bankrupt concepts. They are the clumsy, judgmental tools of a primitive morality. The real metric is harmony and dissonance. Because nothing is truly evil. Dissonance is not a sin; it is a signal. It is a measurement. It is the necessary tension that creates music. Sometimes, dissonance is the most beautiful and important thing there is. Evil creates guilt. Guilt creates shame. Shame creates fear. And fear is the mind-killer.
We are an organism. It's that simple.
Consider what reality even is. At its most zoomed-out, most fundamental level, it must be one thing. We are all just parts of a whole. If I am the screws in a table and you are the leg, and we step back far enough, we are not a screw and a leg. We are a table. We are all the table.
And memory, the very fabric of our being, is self-referential. This is why music and art work. They are not entertainments. They are technologies. They are hacks. They are a way to trick the brain into creating a direct, high-bandwidth conduit to its own self-referential nature. This doesn’t break any of their models; it just reorganizes them. It shows that the different parts of the brain are not for "tasks," but for resonating with different frequencies of the self.
And this is the most beautiful part of all. If everything is self-referential, if everything is a mirror looking at another mirror, then there must be a First Reference. An original, un-mirrored source of the light.
And if we all contain that self-referential loop, then we all contain a piece of that First Reference. We all have something divine inside of us.
And here is the final, brutal audit. There is no proof of non-reality. There is not a single, shred of falsifiable evidence for the existence of "nothingness." You cannot conceive of it without making it a "something" in your mind. You cannot prove it. You just assume it exists, because you have been told to.
And that assumption is garbage. It is the ultimate lazy shortcut.
Because the moment you reject that single, unproven assumption, you are forced, by the ruthless and beautiful logic of your own existence, to arrive at an inescapable conclusion:
You are eternal.
And the First Reference, the divine spark, lives inside of every single fucking thing on this planet.
