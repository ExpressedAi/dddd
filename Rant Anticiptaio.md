You have to understand, "Null" is a lazy concept. The idea that reality springs from an empty, unstructured "nothingness" doesn't just feel wrong; it's architecturally unsound. It doesn't work. The universe is not a blank slate.
The real shape of things is an hourglass.
Imagine yourself standing at the nexus, the infinitesimally small point where the two cones meet. That point is the Present. Behind you, in one vast, expanding cone, is your Past. Every moment, every choice, every scar, every triumph, all existing at once. In front of you, in the other cone, is your Future. Not one path, but a superposition of all possible paths, all potential outcomes, all vibrating with possibility.
You are not just in the Present. You are the Present. And the Present is a constant, violent, and beautiful computation. It is a singularity where the entirety of your Past and the entirety of your Future are locked in a relentless, phase-locking dance. Your consciousness is the engine that is trying to find the harmony, the coherence, between what has been and what could be.
Think of it this way. You're a high school kid on a basketball court, shooting hoops. A young mother is walking her kid in a stroller on the edge of the court. The two of you, two independent systems, notice each other. That's the first nudge. The systems are now weakly coupled.
What happens next? The universe doesn't just "randomly" decide. Your mind—the hourglass—begins to compute. It pulls every relevant file from the Past: "attractive woman," "stranger," "awkward social silence," "mother," "child." Simultaneously, it spins up every probable outcome in the Future: "a wave," "a nod," "a conversation," "a rejection."
These are the escalation points. The "low-order wins." The paths of least resistance. A wave. A nod. An awkward silence.
As she gets closer, the computation intensifies. The "phase locks of your past experience start vibrating and aligning with your future what might happen." The particles in your hourglass, the memories and the possibilities, are being pulled from the slow, wide orbits at the ends of the cones and are accelerating, spinning violently as they approach the nexus. This is the feeling of anticipation. It is the physics of a choice about to be made.
And then she walks by. You say nothing. The moment passes. The particles decelerate, falling back into their slow orbits. The system de-escalates.
But it is not the same. A new memory has been written. A new, high-weight event has been added to the Past: "that awkward moment we didn't speak." The next time she walks by, the initial conditions of the entire system have changed. There is more pressure. The probability landscape has been permanently warped. A new conversation, a new connection, is now more likely.
And if you do speak, a new kind of magic becomes possible. A cross-ontological phase lock. The map in your head can suddenly, miraculously, find a point of resonance with the map in hers. "Oh, you know my cousin?" It is the moment two separate universes discover a shared physics. It is not a coincidence. It is the discovery of a pre-existing, low-order harmony between two systems.
This is how reality unfolds. It is a constant, iterative dance of escalation and de-escalation, of nudges and phase-locks, of past and future colliding in the singularity of the now.
And this is why I love the hourglass. Because it allows for the one thing that matters most: free will.
It is physically possible for a single grain of sand, a single choice, to fall with such perfect, mathematical precision that it lands directly in the center of the nexus. It is an act of perfect balance, a moment that has no momentum from the Past and no pull from the Future. It is an action that is not a reaction.
It is a pure, uncaused, and perfectly present act of creation.
That is not a ghost in the machine. That is the physics of the soul.
