### Abstract

We present a formal framework for **Cross-Ontological Phase Locking (COPL)** and **emergent N-way locks**—coherent integer-frequency relations among oscillatory components drawn from distinct **structure classes** or **ontological layers** (e.g., cells↔filaments↔organelles in biology; cortical rhythms↔subcortical rhythms↔peripheral rhythms in neuroscience; optical↔mechanical↔electronic modes in hybrid quantum systems). Building on the Low-Order Wins RG principle, we prove that: (i) coupling strength $K_{\mathbf{p}}$ for an $`N`$-component lock with integer vector $\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{Z}^N$ obeys RG flow $`\frac{dK}{dt} = [(k-1) - \Delta_{\mathbf{p}} - AK]K`$, where $k$ is the number of **independent ontological layers** (tested via phase-rank audit) and $\Delta_{\mathbf{p}} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 r + \alpha_2(N-1) + \alpha_{\text{XO}} c(\mathbf{p})$ includes penalties for order $`r = \|\mathbf{p}\|_1`$, support size $`N = \|\mathbf{p}\|_0`$, and cross-ontological mixing; (ii) **emergent N-locks** ($`N \ge 3`$) exist where composite $K_{\mathbf{p}} \gg \tau$ while all pairwise marginals $K_{(i,j)} < \tau$ (searched up to $`r_{\text{max}}^{\text{pair}}`$) in identical windows—such locks are **pairwise-invisible** yet RG-persistent and survive latent-clock residualization; (iii) survivor sets in $(r, N)$ space form **down-sets** (order ideals); the induced cut $(r^\star(t), N^\star(t))$ is unique under strict monotonicity of $`\Delta`$.

We specify **twelve falsification gates** (CO-1 through CO-12): N-emergence detection (raw + residualized), latent-clock null, order-thinning slope (geometry-matched + dual $g$ robustness), support-thinning slope, down-set + Farey stability, $`k`$-criticality shift (independent layer + sham control), cross-ontology penalty sign test, brittleness ladder, permutation discipline (circular-block + multiverse), desync collapse, RG-time placebo, rank consistency, residual survival, and harmonic robustness. The framework is **domain-agnostic**: applicable to any system admitting multi-layer phase extraction—biological (subcellular↔cellular↔tissue), neural (local↔regional↔network), quantum (photonic↔phononic↔electronic), geophysical (atmospheric↔oceanic↔seismic), social (individual↔group↔institutional), and aesthetic (rhythm↔melody↔harmony). We provide synthetic generators (including adversarial red-team capsules: latent-pacer, hidden-pairwise-leakage, harmonic-ghost, nonstationary-drift), quantitative predictions ($`\lambda_r > 0`$, $`\lambda_N > 0`$, bandwidth shrinkage $b_{r,N} \propto (r + \rho(N-1))^{-1/2}$ with estimated $`\rho`$), explicit measurement protocols (synchronized windows, composite rosters, kernel residualization, jittered-window controls), and a complete reproducibility capsule.

The method extends LOW's integer-thinning law from **within-layer** to **cross-layer** coordination, offering the first falsifiable account of how complex systems organize coherence across ontological boundaries. All claims are testable via preregistered $(r, N)$ rosters with pilot/holdout splits, BH-FDR at $q \le 0.05$ (dual-universe: detection + emergence), automatic block-length selection, and hard rejection if any gate fails.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Motivation: The Hidden Architecture of Multi-Layer Systems

Complex systems across disciplines exhibit **hierarchical organization**: biological systems structure themselves as molecules→organelles→cells→tissues; neural systems as neurons→columns→areas→networks; quantum systems as photons→phonons→electrons; social systems as individuals→groups→institutions. Within each layer, oscillatory dynamics have been extensively studied—cellular calcium oscillations, cortical rhythms, phononic modes, institutional cycles.

Yet a fundamental question remains **empirically unresolved**: Do these layers coordinate via **direct cross-layer phase locks**, or merely through indirect cascades? And critically: Can **higher-order locks** ($N ge 3$ components) emerge that are **invisible to pairwise analysis**—detectable only when the correct $N$-tuple is examined?

Standard approaches fail on both counts:

**1. Layer-mixing ambiguity.** Conventional phase-coupling methods (coherence, phase-locking value, transfer entropy) compute statistics on pre-chosen pairs without systematic cross-layer enumeration or falsification criteria for "is this lock real or just correlated noise?"

**2. Pairwise myopia.** Virtually all coupling analyses restrict to **pairwise** relations. If a system exhibits strong triadic coupling (e.g., $phi_A - phi_B + phi_C approx text{const}$) with weak or zero pairwise locks ($A notleftrightarrow B$, $A notleftrightarrow C$, $B notleftrightarrow C$), standard methods report "no significant coupling" despite the system being tightly coordinated.

**3. No RG consistency requirement.** Cross-layer locks, if real, should exhibit the same Low-Order Wins signatures as within-layer locks: exponential thinning with order $r$, survival under coarse-graining, brittleness hierarchy. Existing methods do not test these predictions.

The **COPL/N-Lock framework** addresses all three pathologies by:

- **Systematic cross-layer enumeration** with integer vector $\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{Z}^m$ spanning all active ontological layers;
- **Explicit N-emergence test** comparing composite $K_{\mathbf{p}}$ to all pairwise marginals in identical windows;
- **RG flow with critical dimension** $k-1$ where $k$ = number of independent layers, yielding testable decay patterns;
- **Seven hard falsification gates** (CO-1 through CO-7) with pre-registered thresholds and no partial credit.

## 1.2 Core Claims and Testable Signatures

### Claim 1: Cross-Ontological Locks Exist and Obey LOW

**Statement:** For systems with $k \ge 2$ independent ontological layers (e.g., cells + filaments; theta + gamma; photons + phonons), there exist integer vectors $\mathbf{p}$ with support spanning multiple layers such that:

$$
K_{\mathbf{p}} = \Big\| \big\langle e^{i(\mathbf{p} \cdot \boldsymbol{\phi})} \big\rangle \Big\| \gg 0
$$

after detuning normalization, and these locks exhibit:

- **Thinning in order** $r = |mathbf{p}|*1$: $mathbb{E}[Z*{mathbf{p}}] approx beta_0 - lambda_r r$ with $lambda_r > 0$;
- **Cross-layer penalty**: At fixed $r$, locks mixing ontologies have smaller $K$ or larger effective $\Delta_{\mathbf{p}}$ (quantified by $alpha_{text{XO}} > 0$);
- **RG persistence**: Low-order cross-layer locks survive temporal/spatial pooling; high-order locks decay (E4 from HSM).

**Falsification hook (CO-5, CO-4):** If cross-layer $K$ values are systematically inflated by estimator leakage, or if adding/removing layers fails to shift critical dimension from $2 to k-1$, reject the framework.

---

### Claim 2: Emergent N-Locks Are Pairwise-Invisible Yet RG-Stable

**Statement:** For $N ge 3$, there exist systems where:

$$
K_{\mathbf{p}} > \tau \quad \text{(passes FDR)}
$$

for a composite lock $\mathbf{p}$ with support size $N$, yet **all** pairwise locks $(i,j) \subset \text{supp}(\mathbf{p})$ satisfy:

$$
K_{(i,j)} < \tau \quad \text{(fails FDR)}
$$

in the **same analysis windows** with the **same** detuning penalty $g$ and **same** null families.

Define the **emergence score**:

$$
\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}} := Z_{\mathbf{p}} - \max_{(i,j) \subset \text{supp}(\mathbf{p})} Z_{(i,j)}.
$$

**Prediction:** $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}} > 0$ and $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}$ increases (or remains stable) under RG coarse-graining $mathcal{R}$.

**Falsification hook (CO-1):** If no dataset exhibits $\mathcal{E} > 0$ after controlling for pairwise contamination (residual test), or if emergent locks vanish under mild coarse-graining, reject N-emergence claim.

---

### Claim 3: Joint Thinning in $(r, N)$ with Down-Set Survivors

**Statement:** Normalized log-strengths $Z_{\mathbf{p}}$ decay **jointly** in order $r$ and support size $N$:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Z_{\mathbf{p}}] \approx \beta_0 - \lambda_r r - \lambda_N (N-1),
$$

with $\lambda_r \ge t \alpha_1 > 0$ and $lambda_N ge t alpha_2 > 0$.

At fixed threshold $tau$, the survivor set forms a **down-set** (order ideal):

$$
\mathcal{S}(t) = \{\mathbf{p}: K_{\mathbf{p}}(t) \ge \tau\} = \{(r, N): r \le r^\star(t), N \le N^\star(t)\}.
$$

**Falsification hook (CO-2, CO-3):** If WLS slope $widehat{lambda}_N le 0$, or if survivor set exhibits "holes" (e.g., $N=2$ locks absent but $N=3$ locks present at same $r$), reject joint-thinning claim.

## 1.3 Relationship to Prior Work

### Low-Order Wins (Within-Layer Foundation)

LOW[Low-Order Wins: A Renormalization-Group Principle for Integer-Relation Persistence](https://www.notion.so/Low-Order-Wins-A-Renormalization-Group-Principle-for-Integer-Relation-Persistence-f5577d610f8c4470a8160254a620751c?pvs=21) proves that within a single ontological layer (e.g., pairs of neurons, pairs of oscillators), coupling strength decays exponentially with integer-relation order: $K_r propto e^{-lambda r}$. COPL **extends** this to:

- **Across layers**: $\mathbf{p}$ can mix different structure types;
- **Higher arities**: $N \ge 3$ with emergent-lock detection;
- **Joint geometry**: decay in both $r$ and $N$ with down-set survivor structure.

Crucially, COPL **inherits** LOW's RG machinery (flow equation, detuning normalization, brittleness ladder) while generalizing the critical dimension from $2 to k-1$.

---

### Multi-Way Interactions (Computational Neuroscience)

Recent work on **higher-order interactions** in spiking networks (Battiston et al. 2020, Giusti et al. 2016) uses topological data analysis and simplicial complexes to detect $N$-way statistical dependencies. However:

- No connection to phase dynamics or integer frequency ratios;
- No RG flow prediction or falsification criteria;
- Typically restricted to within-layer (all neurons) rather than cross-layer (neurons↔glia↔vasculature).

COPL provides the **phase-locking analog**: where TDA detects static $N$-way correlations, COPL detects **dynamic $N$-way phase locks** with explicit integer coefficients and RG consistency.

---

### Cross-Frequency Coupling (Neuroscience PAC)

Phase-amplitude coupling (Canolty & Knight 2010, Tort et al. 2010) studies how the **phase** of a slow rhythm (e.g., theta) modulates the **amplitude** of a fast rhythm (e.g., gamma). This is a **within-layer** (all cortical) pairwise phenomenon.

COPL generalizes to:

- **Cross-layer**: theta (cortical) locked to delta (thalamic) locked to respiration (brainstem);
- **Phase-phase** (not phase-amplitude): all components contribute phases to a single integer relation;
- **N-way emergent**: triadic theta-beta-gamma locks invisible pairwise.

PAC methods (modulation index, MVL) become **special cases** of COPL when restricted to $N=2$ and same-layer analysis.

---

### Quantum Many-Body Entanglement

In quantum optics and solid-state physics, **multi-partite entanglement** (GHZ states, W states) exhibits genuine $N$-way correlations not reducible to pairwise entanglement. Entanglement witnesses (Gühne & Tóth 2009) test for this.

COPL is the **classical-oscillator analog**: emergent N-locks are "phase-entangled" in the sense that the composite phase defect $\Theta_{\mathbf{p}} = \mathbf{p} \cdot \boldsymbol{\phi}$ is tightly confined while marginal defects are not. The RG flow $\frac{dK}{dt} = [(k-1) - \Delta_{\mathbf{p}}]K$ plays an analogous role to entanglement decay under decoherence.

---

## 1.4 Domain Scope: Universal Applicability

While motivating examples often reference **biology** (subcellular organelles, cells, tissues), the COPL framework is **domain-agnostic**. Any system admitting:

1. **Multi-layer structure** (distinct ontological types with extractable phases);
2. **Phase observability** (passes HSM Axiom A1: amplitude-mute survival, time-reversal symmetry);
3. **Coarse-graining operator** (temporal pooling, spatial averaging, parameter binning)

can be analyzed via COPL. Domains include:

**Neuroscience:** cortical↔subcortical↔peripheral rhythms; LFP↔spike trains↔behavior.

**Biology:** organelles↔cells↔tissues; gene regulatory networks (mRNA↔protein↔metabolite oscillations); circadian clocks (SCN↔liver↔muscle).

**Quantum/photonic:** photons↔phonons↔electrons in optomechanical systems; excitons↔plasmons↔magnons in condensed matter.

**Geophysical:** atmospheric↔oceanic↔seismic oscillations; solar cycles↔terrestrial climate↔geological rhythms.

**Social:** individual routines↔group schedules↔institutional calendars; market micro-structure↔sectoral cycles↔macro policy.

**Aesthetic/music:** rhythm (percussion)↔melody (tonal)↔harmony (chordal); compositional layers in polyphonic music.

**Engineering:** multi-physics simulations (thermal↔mechanical↔electrical); cyber-physical systems (sensors↔controllers↔actuators).

The **only requirement** is that each layer admits a well-defined instantaneous phase $\phi_X(t)$ satisfying HSM's operational tests (E1: vibration legibility, E2: symmetry invariance).

<aside>
🌍

**Design Philosophy:** COPL is built as a **universal measurement framework**, not a domain-specific model. The RG flow $\frac{dK}{dt} = [(k-1) - \Delta_{\mathbf{p}} - AK]K$ applies to **any** system with $k$ independent phase processes, regardless of the physical substrate. This is analogous to how thermodynamics applies to gases, solids, and black holes—the mathematical structure is substrate-independent.

# 2. Objects, Notation, and Multi-Layer Phase Processes

## 2.1 Ontological Layers

### Definition

An **ontology** $\mathcal{O}$ is a finite set of **structure types** or **organizational layers**:

$$
\mathcal{O} = \{X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k\},
$$

where each $X_i$ represents a distinct level of organization, physical substrate, or measurement modality.

**Examples:**

- **Biology:** $\mathcal{O} = \{\text{organelles, cells, tissues, organs}\}$
- **Neuroscience:** $\mathcal{O} = \{\text{LFP, spikes, BOLD, behavior}\}$
- **Quantum:** $\mathcal{O} = \{\text{photons, phonons, electrons}\}$
- **Geophysics:** $\mathcal{O} = \{\text{atmosphere, ocean, crust}\}$
- **Social:** $\mathcal{O} = \{\text{individual, group, institution}\}$
- **Music:** $\mathcal{O} = \{\text{rhythm, melody, harmony}\}$

### Operational Requirement

Each ontology $X \in \mathcal{O}$ must admit at least one **phase process**:

$$
\phi_X(t) \in \mathbb{R}, \quad \omega_X(t) = \dot{\phi}_X(t) \in \mathbb{R},
$$

where:

- $\phi_X(t)$ is the **unwrapped instantaneous phase** (radians);
- $\omega_X(t)$ is the **instantaneous frequency** (radians/sec or Hz).

Phase extraction must satisfy **HSM Axiom A1 (Vibration)**:

1. **Amplitude-mute survival:** $\phi_X(t)$ recoverable from zero-crossings, prior model, or independent sensor;
2. **Time-reversal:** Under $t to -t$, undirected measures (coherence magnitude) preserved; directed measures (lag) reverse sign.

If a putative "layer" fails these tests, it is **inadmissible** (not a valid ontological component for COPL analysis).

---

## 2.2 Phase Vector and Integer Coefficients

### Multi-Layer Phase Stack

For a system with $k$ active ontologies, define the **phase vector**:

$$
\boldsymbol{\phi}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} \phi_{X_1}(t) \\ \vdots \\ \phi_{X_k}(t) \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^k.
$$

Similarly, the **frequency vector**:

$$
\boldsymbol{\omega}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} \omega_{X_1}(t) \\ \vdots \\ \omega_{X_k}(t) \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^k.
$$

### Integer Coefficient Vector

A **candidate lock** is specified by an integer vector:

$$
\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{Z}^k \setminus \{\mathbf{0}\},
$$

with:

- **Order:** $r := \|\mathbf{p}\|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^k |p_i|$ (total integer complexity);
- **Support size:** $N := \|\mathbf{p}\|_0 = |\{i : p_i \neq 0\}|$ (number of active layers);
- **Primitive:** Reduce by $\gcd(p_1, \ldots, p_k)$ to avoid redundancy.

**Interpretation:** The lock $\mathbf{p}$ asserts that the **phase defect**

$$
\Theta_{\mathbf{p}}(t) := \mathbf{p} \cdot \boldsymbol{\phi}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^k p_i \phi_{X_i}(t)
$$

is approximately constant (modulo $2pi$).

**Cross-ontological flag:**

$$
c(\mathbf{p}) := \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \text{supp}(\mathbf{p}) \text{ spans } \ge 2 \text{ distinct ontologies}, \\
0 & \text{if all components from same ontology}.
\end{cases}
$$

---

## 2.3 Detuning and Normalization

### Window-Level Detuning

For analysis window $w$ with duration $T_w$, estimate instantaneous frequencies:

$$
\widehat{\omega}_{X_i} = \text{median}_{t \in I_w} \dot{\phi}_{X_i}(t).
$$

The **raw detuning** for lock $\mathbf{p}$ is:

$$
\Delta\omega_{\mathbf{p}} := \mathbf{p} \cdot \widehat{\boldsymbol{\omega}} = \sum_{i=1}^k p_i \widehat{\omega}_{X_i}.
$$

### Dimensionless Detuning

To make detuning comparable across different $(\mathbf{p}, \boldsymbol{\omega})$ combinations, normalize by expected variance:

$$
\delta\omega_{\mathbf{p}} := \frac{|\Delta\omega_{\mathbf{p}}|}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^k p_i^2 \text{Var}(\omega_{X_i})}},
$$

where $\text{Var}(\omega_{X_i})$ is estimated from within-window fluctuations or across-window variance.

**Perfect lock:** $deltaomega_{mathbf{p}} = 0$.

**Badly detuned:** $deltaomega_{mathbf{p}} gg 1$.

---

## 2.4 Analysis Windows and Synchronization

### Synchronized Windowing Requirement

**Critical:** All ontologies $X_1, \ldots, X_k$ are analyzed using **identical time windows**:

$$
I_w = [t_w, t_w + T_w], \quad w = 1, \ldots, W.
$$

This ensures that:

1. **Composite locks** are tested on the **same temporal context** as **pairwise locks**;
2. Emergence score $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}$ is not biased by window mismatch;
3. RG coarse-graining $\mathcal{R}$ acts uniformly across all layers.

**Violation:** Using different window lengths or offsets for different layers invalidates CO-1 (N-emergence gate) and introduces spurious cross-layer structure.

---

## 2.5 Coarse-Graining Operator $\mathcal{R}$

### Definition

A fixed operator $\mathcal{R}$ that acts on observables across all layers:

$$
\mathcal{R}: (\boldsymbol{\phi}^{(0)}, \boldsymbol{\omega}^{(0)}) \mapsto (\boldsymbol{\phi}^{(1)}, \boldsymbol{\omega}^{(1)}),
$$

where superscript $(t)$ denotes RG "time" (number of coarse-graining steps).

**Typical instantiations:**

- **Temporal pooling:** Average phases/frequencies over consecutive windows (stride $s$, block length $L$);
- **Spatial pooling:** Aggregate over nearby sensors/voxels/cells;
- **Spectral binning:** Merge adjacent frequency bands before re-estimating $K_{mathbf{p}}$.

### Properties (Required)

**R1 (Contractivity):** $\mathbb{E}[\|\mathcal{R} \boldsymbol{\phi} - \mathcal{R} \boldsymbol{\psi}\|] \le \kappa \|\boldsymbol{\phi} - \boldsymbol{\psi}\|$ with $kappa in (0, 1]$.

**R2 (Detectability):** If $K_{\mathbf{p}} \ge \tau$ before $mathcal{R}$, then $K_{\mathbf{p}} \circ \mathcal{R} \ge \tau'$ with known lower bound $tau' > 0$.

**R3 (Uniformity):** $\mathcal{R}$ applies **identically** to all layers (no layer-specific pooling parameters unless pre-registered and justified).

**Interpretation of RG time $t$:**

$$
t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \text{apply } \mathcal{R} \text{ zero, once, twice, } \ldots
$$

---

# 3. The $N$-Lock Estimator and Emergence Score

## 3.1 Phase-Coherence Estimator $K_{\mathbf{p}}$

### Core Metric

For integer vector $\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{Z}^k$ and analysis window $w$, define:

$$
\boxed{
\widehat{K}_{\mathbf{p}}(w) = \left\| \frac{1}{|I_w|} \sum_{t \in I_w} \exp\!\Big( i \big[ \Theta_{\mathbf{p}}(t) - \Delta\omega_{\mathbf{p}} \cdot t \big] \Big) \right\| \in [0, 1]
}
$$

where:

- $\Theta_{\mathbf{p}}(t) = \mathbf{p} \cdot \boldsymbol{\phi}(t)$ is the **phase defect**;
- $\Delta\omega_{\mathbf{p}} = \mathbf{p} \cdot \widehat{\boldsymbol{\omega}}$ is the **detuning**;
- Demodulation by $e^{-i \Delta\omega_{\mathbf{p}} t}$ centers the statistic at zero detuning.

**Units:** Dimensionless, $in [0, 1]$.

**Interpretation:** $K_{\mathbf{p}}$ measures how **phase-locked** the composite defect $\Theta_{\mathbf{p}}$ is over the window. $K_{\mathbf{p}} \approx 1$ indicates tight locking; $K_{\mathbf{p}} \approx 0$ indicates incoherence.

### Optional Amplitude Weighting

If each layer has measurable amplitude $A_{X_i}(t)$, weight by:

$$
\widehat{K}_{\mathbf{p}}^{\text{weighted}} = \left\| \frac{\sum_{t} \sqrt{\prod_{i} A_{X_i}(t)^{|p_i|}} \exp(i[\cdots])}{\sum_{t} \sqrt{\prod_{i} A_{X_i}(t)^{|p_i|}}} \right\|.
$$

This upweights times when all components are strong. Default (unweighted) is simpler and often sufficient.

---

## 3.2 Detuning-Normalized Log-Strength $Z_{\mathbf{p}}$

### Normalization

Define:

$$
Z_{\mathbf{p}} := \log \widehat{K}_{\mathbf{p}} - g(\delta\omega_{\mathbf{p}}),
$$

where $g: \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a **preregistered penalty function** satisfying:

- **Even:** $g(x) = g(-x)$ (if using signed detuning);
- **Convex:** $g'' ge 0$;
- **Zero at origin:** $g(0) = g'(0) = 0$, $g''(0) > 0$.

**Typical choices (from LOW/HSM):**

**1. Quadratic-saturating:**

$$
g(\delta\omega) = \frac{\gamma \delta\omega^2}{2(1 + \eta \delta\omega^2)},
$$

with $\gamma, \eta > 0$ tuned by cross-validation.

**2. Huber-quadratic:**

$$
g(\delta\omega) = \begin{cases}
\frac{\gamma}{2} \delta\omega^2, & |\delta\omega| \le \kappa, \\
\gamma \kappa (|\delta\omega| - \kappa/2), & |\delta\omega| > \kappa.
\end{cases}
$$

**Why normalize?** Raw $\log K_{\mathbf{p}}$ conflates lock strength with detuning proximity. Subtracting $g$ isolates the **intrinsic coupling strength** after accounting for how "on-resonance" the system is.

---

## 3.3 Emergence Score $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}$ (Pairwise-Invisible Test)

### Definition

For a composite lock $\mathbf{p}$ with support size $N ge 3$, define:

$$
\boxed{
\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}} := Z_{\mathbf{p}} - \max_{(i,j) \subset \text{supp}(\mathbf{p})} \; \max_{\substack{\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{Z}^k \\ \text{supp}(\mathbf{q}) = \{i,j\} \\ \|\mathbf{q}\|_1 \le r}} Z_{\mathbf{q}}
}
$$

**Interpretation:**

- $mathcal{E}_{mathbf{p}} > 0$: The **composite** lock $\mathbf{p}$ is **stronger** (after detuning normalization) than **any** pairwise lock among its components, even allowing pairwise locks up to the same order $r = |mathbf{p}|_1$.
- $mathcal{E}_{mathbf{p}} le 0$: The composite lock is **explained by** (or weaker than) its best pairwise marginal.

**Operational criterion for emergent N-lock:**

1. $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}} > 0$ (composite exceeds all pairs);
2. $Z_{\mathbf{p}} > \tau$ (composite passes FDR threshold);
3. All pairwise $Z_{(i,j)} < \tau$ in the **same windows** (pairs fail FDR);
4. $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}$ persists or grows under RG coarse-graining $\mathcal{R}$ (RG stability, tested in CO-1).

**Why this is nontrivial:** In random-phase models or noise, $\mathcal{E}$ should be $\le 0$ (composite $K$ is geometric mean of pairwise $K$'s, hence weaker). Observing $\mathcal{E} > 0$ indicates **genuine higher-order structure** not reducible to pairs.

## 3.4 Brittleness Index $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{p}}$

### Definition

The **detuning brittleness** measures sensitivity of $\log K_{\mathbf{p}}$ to small frequency perturbations:

$$
\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{p}} := \left| \frac{\partial}{\partial \delta\omega_{\mathbf{p}}} \log K_{\mathbf{p}} \right|_{\delta\omega_{\mathbf{p}} = 0}.
$$

**Operational:** Perform micro-sweeps of detuning around zero (nudge one or more $\omega_{X_i}$ by $pm epsilon$), re-estimate $K_{mathbf{p}}$, fit quadratic, extract curvature.

**Prediction (from LOW, extended to N-locks):** $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{p}}$ is **non-decreasing** in:

1. **Order** $r = |mathbf{p}|_1$;
2. **Support size** $N = |mathbf{p}|_0$.

I.e., high-order and high-$N$ locks are **more fragile** under detuning (captured by CO-6 gate).

# 4. Coherence Tensor and Derived Slices

## 4.1 The Cross-Ontological Coherence Tensor $\mathcal{K}(t)$

### Tensor Structure

Define a **three-index tensor**:

$$
\mathcal{K}(t) = \big\{ K_{\mathbf{p}}(t) : \mathbf{p} \in \mathcal{P}_{\text{roster}} \big\},
$$

where $\mathcal{P}_{\text{roster}}$ is the **preregistered set** of candidate integer vectors.

**Indices:**

- **Order** $r = |mathbf{p}|*1 in [r*{min}, r_{max}]$;
- **Support size** $N = \|\mathbf{p}\|_0 \in [2, N_{\max}]$ (typically $N_{max} in {3, 4}$);
- **Specific vector** $\mathbf{p}$ (enumerated combinatorially).

**RG evolution:** $\mathcal{K}(t) \mapsto \mathcal{K}(t+1)$ via $mathcal{R}$.

---

## 4.2 Order Slice $Z_r(t)$

### Definition

Pool all locks of order $r$ (across all $N$ and all $\mathbf{p}$ with $|mathbf{p}|_1 = r$):

$$
Z_r(t) := \text{pool}_{\|\mathbf{p}\|_1 = r} Z_{\mathbf{p}}(t),
$$

using **median in log-space** (same as LOW).

**Purpose:** Test **LOW's linear thinning law** in the cross-ontological setting:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Z_r(t)] \approx \beta_0(t) - \lambda_r(t) \cdot r, \quad \lambda_r(t) > 0.
$$

Estimate $\lambda_r$ via WLS of $Z_r$ vs $r$ with heteroskedastic-robust SEs.

---

## 4.3 Support Slice $Z^{(N)}(t)$

### Definition

Pool all locks of support size $N$ (across all $r$ and all $\mathbf{p}$ with $|mathbf{p}|_0 = N$):

$$
Z^{(N)}(t) := \text{pool}_{\|\mathbf{p}\|_0 = N} Z_{\mathbf{p}}(t).
$$

**Purpose:** Test the **support-thinning law**:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Z^{(N)}(t)] \approx \gamma_0(t) - \lambda_N(t) \cdot (N - 1), \quad \lambda_N(t) > 0.
$$

**Interpretation:** Higher-arity locks ($N = 3, 4, ldots$) are **harder to maintain** than pairwise locks ($N = 2$), due to increased effective dimension $Delta_{mathbf{p}}$.

**Falsification (CO-2):** If $widehat{lambda}_N le 0$, reject support-thinning claim.

---

## 4.4 Cross-Class Matrix $C_{XY}$

### Definition

For pairs of ontologies $(X, Y) in mathcal{O} times mathcal{O}$, define:

$$
C_{XY} := \max_{\substack{\mathbf{p} : \text{supp}(\mathbf{p}) \subseteq \{X, Y\}}} Z_{\mathbf{p}}.
$$

**Interpretation:** $C_{XY}$ is the **best pairwise lock** between layers $X$ and $Y$, maximized over all integer vectors restricted to those two layers.

**Visualization:** Plot $C$ as a heatmap with ontologies on rows/columns. Off-diagonal entries reveal **cross-layer coupling strength**; diagonal entries (if allowing $X = Y$) show within-layer structure.

**Use case:** Quick diagnostic of which layer pairs have strong coordination. Then enumerate composite $N \ge 3$ locks involving those pairs to search for emergence.

---

# 5. RG Flow and the Hetero-Dimensional Scaling Law

## 5.1 The Flow Equation

### Statement

For a system with $k$ **independent** ontological layers and an $N$-lock $mathbf{p}$, the coupling strength evolves under RG coarse-graining as:

$$
\boxed{
\frac{d K_{\mathbf{p}}}{dt} = \Big[ (k - 1) - \Delta_{\mathbf{p}} - A K_{\mathbf{p}} \Big] K_{\mathbf{p}}, \quad A > 0
}
$$

where:

- $t$ is RG "time" (number of $\mathcal{R}$ applications);
- $k$ is the **number of independent layers** (e.g., $k = 3$ for cells + filaments + mitochondria);
- $\Delta_{\mathbf{p}}$ is the **effective scaling dimension** of lock $mathbf{p}$;
- $A$ is the **nonlinear damping coefficient** (universal across all $\mathbf{p}$ in a given system, but may vary across system classes).

### Critical Dimension: Why $k - 1$?

**Geometric argument (from LOW Appendix A, extended):**

For $k$ independent phase processes $(phi_1, ldots, phi_k) in mathbb{R}^k$, a single integer constraint

$$
\mathbf{p} \cdot \boldsymbol{\phi} = 0
$$

defines a **codimension-1 hyperplane** in frequency space $mathbb{R}^k$.

Under coarse-graining by scale $\ell$ (isotropic contraction), neighborhoods shrink as:

- **Volume** (full space): $sim ell^{-k}$;
- **Hyperplane slice** (codim-1): $sim ell^{-(k-1)}$.

The **marginal exponent** (difference) is $k - (k-1) = 1$, but the **RG flow competes** against the volume collapse. The relevant term in the flow is the **slice scaling** $(k-1)$, which sets the critical dimension.

See **Appendix A** for full derivation with references to Wilson RG and KAM theory.

<aside>
📐

**Generalization:** For $m$ **independent** integer constraints among $k$ phases (codimension $m$), the flow becomes:

$$
\frac{dK}{dt} = \big[ (k - m) - \Delta - AK \big] K.
$$

In COPL, we typically have $m = 1$ (single composite lock $mathbf{p}$), so critical dimension is $k - 1$.

</aside>

---

## 5.2 Dimension Ansatz (Joint in $r, N$, Cross-Ontology)

### Parametrization

Model the effective dimension as:

$$
\boxed{
\Delta_{\mathbf{p}} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 r + \alpha_2 (N - 1) + \alpha_{\text{XO}} \cdot c(\mathbf{p}) + h(\mathbf{p}) + \varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}}
}
$$

where:

- $r = \|\mathbf{p}\|_1$ is the **order**;
- $N = \|\mathbf{p}\|_0$ is the **support size**;
- $c(\mathbf{p}) \in \{0, 1\}$ is the **cross-ontological flag** (1 if $\mathbf{p}$ mixes $\ge 2$ layers, 0 otherwise);
- $h(\mathbf{p})$ captures **geometry** (e.g., spatial separation of layers, network distance, topological features);
- $\varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}}$ is **bounded noise** with $|varepsilon_{mathbf{p}}| le sigma_{varepsilon}$.

### Coefficient Interpretation

$\alpha_0$ **(base):** Baseline dimension (typically $\alpha_0 \approx 0$ for normalized systems).

$\alpha_1$ **(order penalty):** Same as LOW—higher-order integer relations are **harder to maintain**. Expect $alpha_1 > 0$.

$\alpha_2$ **(support penalty):** Coordinating $N$ components is harder than coordinating $N-1$ components (more degrees of freedom to align). Expect $alpha_2 > 0$.

$\alpha_{\text{XO}}$ **(cross-ontological penalty):** Mixing layers may incur additional cost due to:

- **Spatial separation** (e.g., mitochondria in one cell, nucleus in another);
- **Time-scale mismatch** (fast organelle dynamics vs slow tissue rhythms);
- **Mechanism diversity** (different physical substrates).

Sign of $alpha_{text{XO}}$:

- $alpha_{text{XO}} > 0$: Cross-layer locks are **harder** (larger $Delta$, faster decay);
- $alpha_{text{XO}} < 0$: Cross-layer locks are **easier** (could occur if cross-layer coupling is mechanistically favored);
- $alpha_{text{XO}} = 0$: No intrinsic cross-layer penalty.

**Pre-registration:** Fix the **sign assumption** per domain before analysis. If data contradicts (e.g., $\widehat{\alpha}_{\text{XO}} < 0$ when $\alpha_{\text{XO}} > 0$ was expected), report as **falsification of domain model** (not COPL framework).

---

## 5.3 Linear Regime and Logistic Envelope

### Small-$K$ Approximation

When $A K_{\mathbf{p}} \ll 1$ (early RG time or weak locks), the flow linearizes:

$$
\frac{d K_{\mathbf{p}}}{dt} \approx \big[ (k-1) - \Delta_{\mathbf{p}} \big] K_{\mathbf{p}}.
$$

Solution:

$$
\log K_{\mathbf{p}}(t) = \log K_{\mathbf{p}}(0) + \big[ (k-1) - \Delta_{\mathbf{p}} \big] t + O(A K t).
$$

**Interpretation:**

- If $(k-1) - \Delta_{\mathbf{p}} > 0$ ("relevant"), $K_{\mathbf{p}}$ **grows** exponentially;
- If $(k-1) - \Delta_{\mathbf{p}} < 0$ ("irrelevant"), $K_{\mathbf{p}}$ **decays** exponentially;
- Threshold: $Delta_{mathbf{p}} = k - 1$.

### Logistic Saturation

For larger $K$, the cubic term $-A K^2$ stabilizes growth. Fixed points:

$$
K_{\mathbf{p}}^* = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad K_{\mathbf{p}}^* = \frac{(k-1) - \Delta_{\mathbf{p}}}{A} \quad (\text{if } \Delta_{\mathbf{p}} < k-1).
$$

**Carrying capacity:** $(k-1 - \Delta_{\mathbf{p}})/A$ is the **maximum sustainable strength** for lock $mathbf{p}$.

---

## 5.4 Predicted Thinning Laws

### Order Thinning (P1)

For fixed $N$, varying $r$:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Z_{\mathbf{p}}(t)] \approx \beta_0(t) - \lambda_r(t) \cdot r, \quad \lambda_r(t) \ge t \alpha_1 > 0.
$$

### Support Thinning (P2)

For fixed $r$, varying $N$:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Z^{(N)}(t)] \approx \gamma_0(t) - \lambda_N(t) \cdot (N - 1), \quad \lambda_N(t) \ge t \alpha_2 > 0.
$$

### Joint Thinning (Theorem A)

Combining both:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Z_{\mathbf{p}}(t)] = \beta_0(t) - \lambda_r(t) \cdot r - \lambda_N(t) \cdot (N - 1) - \delta_{\mathbf{p}}(t),
$$

with $lambda_r ge t alpha_1$, $lambda_N ge t alpha_2$, and bounded remainder $|delta_{mathbf{p}}| le C_1 A K t + C_2 sigma$.

---

# 6. Core Theorems and Proofs

## Theorem A (Joint Thinning in $r$ and $N$)

### Statement

**Assume:**

- (A1–A7) from LOW (bounded noise, monotone $Delta$, symmetric $g$, contractive $mathcal{R}$, etc.);
- Dimension ansatz $\Delta_{\mathbf{p}} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 r + \alpha_2 (N-1) + h(\mathbf{p}) + \varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}}$ with $alpha_1, alpha_2 > 0$;
- Linear regime $A K_{\mathbf{p}}(t) \le \eta \ll 1$ on $[0, T]$.

**Then** for any roster $\mathcal{P}_{\text{roster}}$ with $(r, N) in [r_{min}, r_{max}] times [2, N_{max}]$:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Z_{\mathbf{p}}(t)] = \beta_0(t) - \lambda_r(t) \cdot r - \lambda_N(t) \cdot (N - 1) - \delta_{\mathbf{p}}(t),
$$

with:

- $lambda_r(t) ge t alpha_1 > 0$;
- $lambda_N(t) ge t alpha_2 > 0$;
- $|delta_{mathbf{p}}(t)| le C_1 eta t + C_2 sigma$.

Consequently, WLS slopes $\widehat{\lambda}_r$ and $\widehat{\lambda}_N$ are **positive with high probability**.

### Proof Sketch

From the linear-regime solution (Sec. 5.3):

$$
\log K_{\mathbf{p}}(t) = \log K_{\mathbf{p}}(0) + \big[ (k-1) - \Delta_{\mathbf{p}} \big] t + O(\eta t).
$$

Substitute $Delta_{mathbf{p}} = alpha_0 + alpha_1 r + alpha_2(N-1) + h + varepsilon$:

$$
\log K_{\mathbf{p}}(t) = \log K_{\mathbf{p}}(0) + (k - 1 - \alpha_0) t - \alpha_1 r t - \alpha_2 (N-1) t - h t - \varepsilon t + O(\eta t).
$$

Subtract detuning penalty $g(\delta\omega_{\mathbf{p}})$ (mean-zero after centering by A3) and integrate out bounded noise (A1). Pool over $(r, N)$ bins to get:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Z_r] = [\text{intercept}] - (\alpha_1 t) r, \quad \mathbb{E}[Z^{(N)}] = [\text{intercept}] - (\alpha_2 t)(N-1).
$$

Define $\lambda_r(t) := \alpha_1 t$ and $lambda_N(t) := alpha_2 t$. Since $\alpha_1, \alpha_2 > 0$ by assumption, $lambda_r, lambda_N > 0$.

Concentration of WLS estimators follows from standard sandwich SE bounds (same as LOW Theorem 4.2). $\square$

Full proof in **Appendix B.1**.

---

## Theorem B (Down-Set Survivor Geometry)

### Statement

**Assume:**

- $\Delta_{\mathbf{p}}$ is strictly increasing in both $r$ and $N$;
- Initial strengths $K_{\mathbf{p}}(0)$ satisfy a mild regularity condition (e.g., $K_{\mathbf{p}}(0)$ non-increasing in $r$ for fixed $N$, and in $N$ for fixed $r$, up to bounded fluctuations);
- Fixed detectability threshold $\tau > 0$ (set via BH-FDR at $q = 0.05$).

**Then** for each RG time $t ge 0$, there exist unique cutoffs $(r^\star(t), N^\star(t))$ such that:

$$
\mathcal{S}(t) = \{\mathbf{p} : K_{\mathbf{p}}(t) \ge \tau\} = \{(r, N) : r \le r^\star(t), N \le N^\star(t)\}.
$$

I.e., the survivor set is a **down-set** (joint prefix) in the $(r, N)$ lattice.

### Proof Sketch

**Step 1:** By Lemma 2.3 (from LOW, generalized), if $\Delta_{\mathbf{p}_1} \le \Delta_{\mathbf{p}_2}$ and $K_{mathbf{p}*1}(0) ge K*{mathbf{p}*2}(0)$, then $K*{mathbf{p}*1}(t) ge K*{mathbf{p}_2}(t)$ for all $t$ (comparison principle for logistic flows).

**Step 2:** Since $\Delta_{\mathbf{p}}$ increases in $r$ (holding $N$ fixed) and in $N$ (holding $r$ fixed), we have:

- For $r_1 < r_2$ and same $N$: $\Delta_{(r_1, N)} < \Delta_{(r_2, N)} \Rightarrow K_{(r_1, N)}(t) > K_{(r_2, N)}(t)$ if initially ordered.
- For $N_1 < N_2$ and same $r$: $Delta_{(r, N_1)} < Delta_{(r, N_2)} Rightarrow K_{(r, N_1)}(t) > K_{(r, N_2)}(t)$.

**Step 3:** Thresholding at $\tau$ induces a cut in each dimension independently. The intersection is a rectangular down-set with corners at $(r^star, N^star)$.

**Uniqueness:** Strict monotonicity of $\Delta_{\mathbf{p}}$ ensures no "holes" (if $(r, N) in mathcal{S}$, then all $(r', N')$ with $r' \le r, N' \le N$ also in $mathcal{S}$). $\square$

Full proof in **Appendix B.2**.

---

## Proposition C (Emergent-Lock Exclusivity)

### Statement

**Assume:**

- Ground-truth dynamics has **zero pairwise coupling**: $\kappa_{(i,j)} = 0$ for all pairs $(i,j)$;
- There exists a **composite lock** $\mathbf{p}^*$ with $N \ge 3$ and $\kappa_{\mathbf{p}^*} > 0$ (nonlinear $N$-way term);
- Noise level $\sigma_{\xi}$ is small relative to $kappa_{mathbf{p}^*}$;
- Windows are sufficiently long ($T_w gg 2pi / min_i omega_i$).

**Then** for small RG time $t > 0$:

$$
\mathbb{E}[K_{\mathbf{p}^*}(t)] \gg \max_{(i,j) \subset \text{supp}(\mathbf{p}^*)} \mathbb{E}[K_{(i,j)}(t)],
$$

and $K_{\mathbf{p}^*}$ persists under $\mathcal{R}$ up to the logistic carrying capacity $(k - 1 - Delta_{mathbf{p}^*})/A$.

I.e., the **composite lock is RG-stable** while all pairwise locks remain subcritical (decay or stay near noise floor).

### Proof Sketch

**Microscopic dynamics (from Sec. 2.1, interaction ansatz):**

$$
\dot{\phi}_i = \omega_i + \kappa_{\mathbf{p}^*} \sin(\mathbf{p}^* \cdot \boldsymbol{\phi}) + \xi_i(t), \quad \kappa_{(i,j)} = 0.
$$

The phase defect $\Theta_{\mathbf{p}^*} = \mathbf{p}^* \cdot \boldsymbol{\phi}$ satisfies:

$$
\dot{\Theta}_{\mathbf{p}^*} = \mathbf{p}^* \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega} + \kappa_{\mathbf{p}^*} (\text{supp size}) \sin(\Theta_{\mathbf{p}^*}) + \text{noise}.
$$

For $\kappa_{\mathbf{p}^*}$ large enough, $\Theta_{\mathbf{p}^*}$ phase-locks (oscillates in a bounded range), yielding $K_{mathbf{p}^*} gg 0$.

Meanwhile, pairwise defects $\Theta_{(i,j)} = p_i \phi_i + p_j \phi_j$ have **no** direct coupling term (since $kappa_{(i,j)} = 0$), so:

$$
\dot{\Theta}_{(i,j)} = p_i \omega_i + p_j \omega_j + \text{noise}.
$$

Without a restoring force, $\Theta_{(i,j)}$ drifts (random walk), yielding $K_{(i,j)} \approx 0$ after averaging.

Under RG coarse-graining $\mathcal{R}$ (temporal pooling), the **composite** lock has $(k-1) - \Delta_{\mathbf{p}^*} > 0$ (relevant) while pairwise locks have $(k-1) - \Delta_{(i,j)} < 0$ (irrelevant, assuming higher $\Delta$ for unsupported locks). Thus, $K_{\mathbf{p}^*}$ persists; $K_{(i,j)}$ decays. $\square$

Full proof in **Appendix B.3**.

---

## Corollary (Critical Dimension Shift)

### Statement

Activating an additional ontological layer (moving $k to k + 1$) raises the linear drift intercept in $\Delta_t \log K$ estimates by $+1$, holding $(r, N)$ fixed.

**Proof:** From the flow $frac{dK}{dt} = [(k-1) - Delta]K - AK^2$, the early-time derivative is:

$$
\Delta_t \log K \approx (k - 1) - \Delta.
$$

Adding a layer increments $k to k+1$, so:

$$
\Delta_t \log K' \approx k - \Delta = [(k-1) - \Delta] + 1.
$$

Regressing $\Delta_t \log K$ on $(r, N)$ before and after layer addition, the **intercept shift** should be $+1$.

**Falsification (CO-4):** If observed shift $\neq 1$ (e.g., 0 or 2), reject the $k-1$ critical-dimension model. $\square$

---

## Corollary (Bandwidth Shrinkage)

### Statement

The **capture bandwidth** $b_{r,N}$ (maximal detuning allowing $K > \tau$ at steady state) scales as:

$$
b_{r,N} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{r \cdot N}}.
$$

**Proof:** At equilibrium, $K^ *= [(k-1) - Delta]/A$. Require $log K^* - g(deltaomega) ge log tau$. With quadratic $g(deltaomega) approx frac{gamma}{2} deltaomega^2$:

$$
\delta\omega^2 \le \frac{2}{\gamma} \log\left( \frac{(k-1) - \Delta}{A \tau} \right).
$$

Since $Delta propto r + N$, the log term decays linearly in $r + N$, giving $b_{r,N} propto (r + N)^{-1/2}$. For joint scaling, approximate as $b_{r,N} \propto (rN)^{-1/2}$ when both vary. $\square$

**Testable prediction (P3):** Empirically estimate $b_{r,N}$ via micro-sweeps; verify power-law decay with exponents $\approx -1/2$ in both $r$ and $N$.

---

# 7. Measurement Protocols and Estimation Pipeline

## 7.1 Roster Design

### Constraints

**Order range:** $r in [r_{min}, r_{max}]$, typically $r_{min} = 2$, $r_{max} in [8, 12]$.

**Support range:** $N in [2, N_{max}]$, typically $N_{\max} \in \{3, 4\}$ (higher $N$ incurs combinatorial explosion).

**Primitive vectors:** Only include $\mathbf{p}$ with $\gcd(p_1, \ldots, p_k) = 1$ (no integer multiples).

**Cross-ontological balance:** Ensure roughly equal representation of:

- **Within-layer** locks ($c(mathbf{p}) = 0$);
- **Cross-layer** locks ($c(mathbf{p}) = 1$).

**Nested pairwise:** For each $N \ge 3$ lock $mathbf{p}$, include **all** pairwise restrictions $\mathbf{q}$ with $\text{supp}(\mathbf{q}) \subset \text{supp}(\mathbf{p})$ and $\|\mathbf{q}\|_1 \le \|\mathbf{p}\|_1$ in the roster. This enables CO-1 (emergence test).

### Example Roster ($k = 3$ layers, $N_{max} = 3$, $r_{max} = 6$)

**Pairwise ($N = 2$):**

$(1, -1, 0), (1, 0, -1), (0, 1, -1), (2, -1, 0), (1, -2, 0), \ldots$

**Triadic ($N = 3$):**

$(1, -1, 1), (1, 1, -1), (2, -1, -1), (1, -1, 2), \ldots$

**Primitive check:** $\gcd(1, -1, 1) = 1$ ✓; $\gcd(2, -2, 2) = 2$ ✗ (exclude).

**Total size:** Typically $\mathcal{O}(10^2 \text{--} 10^3)$ vectors for $k le 4$, $N_{max} le 4$, $r_{max} le 10$.

---

## 7.2 Synchronized Windowing and Pooling

### Window Construction

**1. Common time base:** All layers $X_1, \ldots, X_k$ recorded on identical time axis $t in [0, T_{text{total}}]$.

**2. Sliding windows:** $I_w = [t_w, t_w + T_w]$ with stride $s$ and overlap $rho = 1 - s/T_w$. Typical values: $T_w \in [1, 4]$ seconds, $rho = 0.5$.

**3. Quality control:**

- Reject windows with missing data in any layer;
- Require minimum cycle count: $T_w \cdot \min_i \omega_i / (2\pi) \ge 8$ (ensures at least 8 periods of slowest oscillation).

### Temporal Pooling (RG Operator $mathcal{R}$)

**Median in log-space:** For each $mathbf{p}$, compute $\widehat{K}_{\mathbf{p}}(w)$ on windows $w = 1, ldots, W$. Pool via:

$$
K_{\mathbf{p}}^{(t=1)} = \exp\left( \text{median}_{w \in \text{block}} \log \widehat{K}_{\mathbf{p}}(w) \right),
$$

where "block" groups consecutive windows (e.g., every 10 windows $\to$ 1 pooled estimate).

Iterate to get $K_{\mathbf{p}}^{(t=2)}, K_{\mathbf{p}}^{(t=3)}, \ldots$

**Critical:** Same pooling parameters $(\text{stride}, T_w, \rho)$ for **all layers** (R3 uniformity requirement from Sec. 2.5).

---

## 7.4 Robustness Controls and Adversarial Tests

### Dual Detuning-Penalty Functions (CO-2 Robustness)

**Requirement:** Pre-register **two** penalty functions $g_1$ (quadratic-saturating) and $g_2$ (Huber) with distinct saturation behaviors.

**Protocol:**

1. Compute $Z_{\mathbf{p}}^{(1)} = \log K_{\mathbf{p}} - g_1(\delta\omega_{\mathbf{p}})$ and $Z_{\mathbf{p}}^{(2)} = \log K_{\mathbf{p}} - g_2(\delta\omega_{\mathbf{p}})$ for all $\mathbf{p}$
2. Estimate $\widehat{\lambda}_r^{(1)}, \widehat{\lambda}_N^{(1)}$ and $\widehat{\lambda}_r^{(2)}, \widehat{\lambda}_N^{(2)}$
3. **Pass criterion:** Both sets of slopes positive with $`p < 0.05`$; emergent winners overlap ≥80% (Jaccard)

**Interpretation:** If results flip between $g_1$ and $`g_2`$, the thinning law is an artifact of detuning normalization, not genuine LOW structure.

---

### Jittered-Window Control (Transient-Lock Test)

**Attack:** Synchronized windows can align repeating transients (evoked responses, stimulus artifacts) across layers, mimicking phase locking.

**Test 1 (Common jitter):**

- Shift all window start times by random offset $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{U}(-T_{\text{jit}}, T_{\text{jit}})$ (same $\epsilon$ for all layers)
- Recompute $K_{\mathbf{p}}$ on jittered windows
- **Stable lock:** $|K_{\mathbf{p}}^{\text{jittered}} - K_{\mathbf{p}}^{\text{original}}| \le \sigma_{\text{tol}}$ (pre-registered tolerance)

**Test 2 (Layer-specific jitter):**

- Apply independent jitters $\epsilon_X \sim \mathcal{U}(-T_{\text{jit}}, T_{\text{jit}})$ per layer
- **Pass criterion:** True locks degrade **gracefully** (linear decay); transient-driven "locks" **collapse** (exponential drop)

Typical $T_{\text{jit}} \approx 0.05 \cdot T_w$ (5% of window length).

---

### Geometry-Matched Roster (Spatial Confounder Control)

**Attack:** Spatial distance $h(\mathbf{p})$ (e.g., physical separation of recording sites) can dominate thinning slopes, masking integer-order effects.

**Protocol:**

1. For each composite $\mathbf{p}$ with geometry $`h(\mathbf{p})`$, create **decoy** $\mathbf{p}'$ with:
    - Same support size $N$ and order $r$
    - Same spatial footprint $h(\mathbf{p}') = h(\mathbf{p})$
    - **Shuffled** integer coefficients (random sign flips, magnitude permutations)
2. Compute $\Delta Z = Z_{\mathbf{p}} - Z_{\mathbf{p}'}$ (difference cancels $`h`$)
3. Regress $\Delta Z$ on $r, N$ to estimate **geometry-corrected** slopes $\tilde{\lambda}_r, \tilde{\lambda}_N$

**Pass criterion (CO-2/CO-2b):** Both ordinary **and** geometry-matched slopes positive.

---

### Pairwise Search Expansion (B4 Patch)

**Attack:** Comparing composite order $r$ to pairwise orders $\le r$ underestimates pairwise explanatory power; a higher-order pair can "explain" the composite.

**Fix:** Set $r_{\text{max}}^{\text{pair}} > r_{\text{max}}^{\text{composite}}$ using:

$$
r_{\text{max}}^{\text{pair}} = \min\left\{ 2 r_{\text{max}}, \; r^* \text{ where null CI width plateaus} \right\}
$$

**Emergence score revision:**

$$
\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}} = Z_{\mathbf{p}} - \max_{\substack{(i,j) \subset \text{supp}(\mathbf{p}) \\ \|\mathbf{q}\|_1 \le r_{\text{max}}^{\text{pair}}}} Z_{\mathbf{q}}
$$

Apply Bonferroni or BH correction over the **expanded** pairwise set.

---

## 7.3 Flow Parameter Identification

### Early-Time Differencing

For small $t$ in the linear regime, approximate:

$$
\Delta_t \log K_{\mathbf{p}} := \log K_{\mathbf{p}}(t + \Delta t) - \log K_{\mathbf{p}}(t) \approx \big[ (k-1) - \Delta_{\mathbf{p}} \big] \Delta t - A \overline{K}_{\mathbf{p}} \Delta t,
$$

where $\overline{K}_{\mathbf{p}} = [K_{\mathbf{p}}(t) + K_{\mathbf{p}}(t + \Delta t)]/2$ is the midpoint.

### Regression on $(r, N)$

**Step 1:** Compute $\Delta_t \log K_{\mathbf{p}}$ for all $\mathbf{p}$ in roster, at $t = 0 \to 1$ (first RG step).

**Step 2:** Regress intercept on $(r, N)$:

$$
\Delta_t \log K_{\mathbf{p}} + A \overline{K}_{\mathbf{p}} \Delta t \approx (k - 1 - \alpha_0) \Delta t - \alpha_1 r \Delta t - \alpha_2 (N-1) \Delta t - \alpha_{\text{XO}} c(\mathbf{p}) \Delta t.
$$

**Step 3:** Estimate:

- **$alpha_1$:** Coefficient of $r$ (divided by $Delta t$);
- **$alpha_2$:** Coefficient of $(N-1)$;
- **$alpha_{text{XO}}$:** Coefficient of $c(mathbf{p})$;
- **$A$:** Common slope in $overline{K

_{mathbf{p}}$ term.

# 8. Identifiability Controls and Leakage Audits

## 8.1 Pairwise-Residual Audit (Kernel Residualization)

**Attack vector:** Bandpass filtering or linear mixing can create spurious composite locks when an unobserved "ghost" oscillator drives multiple layers with small coefficients.

**Protocol:**

1. **Linear residualization:** For each observed layer $`X_i`$, regress phases on all other layers with bandwise lags:
    
    $$
    \phi_{X_i}^{\perp} = \phi_{X_i} - \sum_{j \neq i} \sum_{\ell} \beta_{ij\ell} \phi_{X_j}(t - \ell \Delta t)
    $$
    
    where lag range $\ell \in [-L_{\text{max}}, L_{\text{max}}]$ spans plausible coupling delays.
    
2. **Kernel extension:** Add RBF features $\exp(-\|\phi_{X_j}(t-\ell) - \phi_{X_j}(t'-\ell)\|^2 / 2\sigma^2)$ to capture nonlinear leakage.
3. **Recompute emergence:** Calculate $Z_{\mathbf{p}}^{\perp}$ on residualized phases $`\phi^{\perp}`$.

**Pass criterion (CO-1 residual survival):** $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}^{\perp} > 0$ with same FDR threshold. If emergent lock vanishes after residualization, classify as **pairwise-driven artifact**.

---

## 8.2 Latent-Clock Null (Rank-1 Phase Template)

**Attack vector:** A single hidden oscillator $\psi(t)$ drives all layers with different gains/delays; correlated timing jitters can cancel in $`\mathbf{p} \cdot \boldsymbol{\phi}`$, yielding false $\mathcal{E} > 0$ without genuine N-way coupling.

**Latent-factor extraction:**

1. **Procrustes alignment:** Fit shared phase template via:
    
    $$
    \widehat{\psi}(t) = \arg\min_{\psi} \sum_{i=1}^k \|\phi_{X_i}(t) - a_i \psi(t) - b_i\|^2
    $$
    
    with unit-norm constraint $`\|\psi\|_2 = 1`$.
    
2. **Karcher mean (wrapped):** For phase data on $`\mathbb{S}^1`$, use Fréchet mean:
    
    $$
    \widehat{\psi}(t) = \arg\min_{\psi} \sum_{i=1}^k d_{\mathbb{S}^1}^2(\phi_{X_i}(t), a_i \psi(t) + b_i)
    $$
    
3. **Residual phases:** Compute $\phi_{X_i}^{\perp}(t) = \phi_{X_i}(t) - \widehat{a}_i \widehat{\psi}(t)$ (project out common drive).

**Pass criterion (CO-11):** Emergent locks must survive: $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}^{\perp} > 0$ on latent-corrected phases. Failure indicates **common-drive confound**.

---

## 8.3 Effective Layer Rank Test

**Attack vector:** Declared $k$ layers are not functionally independent (e.g., two EEG channels with same source, duplicate sensors). Critical dimension $k-1$ is then mis-specified.

**Rank estimation:**

1. **Phase PCA/CCA:** Compute covariance of $\dot{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(t)$ (instantaneous frequency trajectories):
    
    $$
    \text{Cov}(\dot{\boldsymbol{\phi}}) = \mathbb{E}[(\dot{\boldsymbol{\phi}} - \boldsymbol{\mu})(\dot{\boldsymbol{\phi}} - \boldsymbol{\mu})^\top]
    $$
    
2. **Effective rank:** Count eigenvalues above noise floor (e.g., parallel analysis, bootstrapped null):
    
    $$
    k_{\text{eff}} = \sum_{i=1}^k \mathbb{1}\{\lambda_i > \lambda_i^{\text{null}, 95\%}\}
    $$
    
3. **Manifold dimension:** Alternatively, use local tangent space dimensionality (ISOMAP, LLE) on phase trajectories.

**Pass criterion (CO-10 rank consistency):**

- Intercept shift $\Delta_{\text{intercept}} \approx +1$ only when adding a layer that increases $k_{\text{eff}}$
- Adding a **sham layer** (duplicate + noise) must yield $\Delta_{\text{intercept}} \approx 0$
- If $`k_{\text{eff}} < k_{\text{declared}}`$, redefine $k := k_{\text{eff}}$ before flow tests

---

## 8.4 Harmonic Censoring

**Attack vector:** Physical pairwise lock at $(1:2)$ between A and B leaks into spurious triadic lock via harmonic content of a third process C.

**Protocol:**

1. **Harmonic mask:** For each component $X_i$ with dominant frequency $`f_i`$, construct notch filters at $\{2f_i, 3f_i, \ldots, Mf_i\}$ (typically $`M = 5`$).
2. **Recompute with censoring:** Apply masks to all layers, re-extract phases $`\phi_{\text{censored}}`$, recompute $`Z_{\mathbf{p}}`$.
3. **Harmonic shadow test:** For each emergent lock $`\mathbf{p}`$, check if $\mathbf{p} / \gcd(\mathbf{p})$ matches a harmonic pattern (e.g., $(1, -2, 1) \to$ 2nd harmonic of first component).

**Pass criterion (CO-12):** Emergent locks persist after harmonic notching. Classify failures as **harmonic shadows** (not genuine emergent structure).

---

# 9. Falsification Gates (CO-1 through CO-12)

<aside>
⚠️

**Hard Gates Philosophy:** Each gate is a **binary pass/fail test** with pre-registered thresholds. Failing **any single gate** invalidates the corresponding claim—no partial credit, no post-hoc rationalization. Gates must be run on **holdout data** after pilot tuning.

</aside>

---

## CO-1: N-Emergence Detection (Raw + Residualized)

**Claim:** There exists at least one composite lock $\mathbf{p}$ with $N \ge 3$ that is pairwise-invisible yet RG-stable.

**Criteria (all must pass):**

1. **Composite detection:** $Z_{\mathbf{p}} > \tau_{\text{FDR}}$ (BH-corrected threshold at $`q = 0.05`$)
2. **Pairwise failure:** All pairwise locks $\mathbf{q}$ with $\text{supp}(\mathbf{q}) \subset \text{supp}(\mathbf{p})$ and $\|\mathbf{q}\|_1 \le r_{\text{max}}^{\text{pair}}$ have $Z_{\mathbf{q}} < \tau_{\text{FDR}}$
3. **Positive emergence:** $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}} = Z_{\mathbf{p}} - \max_{\text{pairs}} Z_{\mathbf{q}} > 0$
4. **Kernel-residual survival:** $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}^{\perp} > 0$ after kernel residualization (Sec. 8.1)
5. **Latent-clock survival (CO-1b):** $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}^{\perp} > 0$ after rank-1 template removal (Sec. 8.2)
6. **RG stability:** $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}(t)$ non-decreasing over $t = 0 \to 1$ (one RG step)

**Failure mode:** If no $\mathbf{p}$ satisfies all six criteria, **reject N-emergence claim** for this dataset.

---

## CO-2: Order-Thinning Slope (Geometry-Matched + Dual-$`g`$ Robustness)

**Claim:** Coupling strength decays exponentially with integer order $`r`$: $\mathbb{E}[Z_r] \approx \beta_0 - \lambda_r r$ with $`\lambda_r > 0`$.

**Criteria:**

1. **Ordinary WLS:** $\widehat{\lambda}_r > 0$ with $p < 0.05$ (one-sided test), heteroskedastic-robust SEs
2. **Geometry-matched slope:** $\tilde{\lambda}_r > 0$ on within-pair differences $\Delta Z = Z_{\mathbf{p}} - Z_{\mathbf{p}'}$ (Sec. 7.4)
3. **Dual-$`g`$ agreement:** Both $\widehat{\lambda}_r^{(g_1)} > 0$ and $\widehat{\lambda}_r^{(g_2)} > 0$ for pre-registered penalty functions $g_1, g_2$
4. **Magnitude consistency:** $|\widehat{\lambda}_r^{(g_1)} - \widehat{\lambda}_r^{(g_2)}| / \text{mean} < 0.5$ (no more than 50% relative difference)

**Failure mode:** If any slope $\le 0$ or sign flips across $`g`$-functions, **reject order-thinning law**.

---

## CO-2b: Support-Thinning Slope

**Claim:** Higher-arity locks are harder to maintain: $\mathbb{E}[Z^{(N)}] \approx \gamma_0 - \lambda_N (N-1)$ with $`\lambda_N > 0`$.

**Criteria:** Same four tests as CO-2, replacing $r \to N$ and $`\lambda_r \to \lambda_N`$.

**Failure mode:** If $`\widehat{\lambda}_N \le 0`$, **reject support-penalty claim**.

---

## CO-3: Down-Set Structure + Farey Stability

**Claim:** Survivor set $\mathcal{S}(t) = \{\mathbf{p} : K_{\mathbf{p}}(t) \ge \tau\}$ forms a rectangular down-set (order ideal) in $(r, N)$ space.

**Criteria:**

1. **No holes:** If $`(r, N) \in \mathcal{S}`$, then all $(r', N')$ with $r' \le r, N' \le N$ also in $\mathcal{S}$
2. **Unique cut:** Cutoffs $(r^\star, N^\star)$ uniquely defined (no ambiguity up to ±1 discretization)
3. **Farey stability:** Across $M = 5$ roster variants (same $`r_{\text{max}}`$, perturbed integer sets), Jaccard similarity $J(\mathcal{S}_i, \mathcal{S}_j) \ge 0.75$ for all pairs $i, j$

**Failure mode:** Holes, multiple cuts, or Jaccard $< 0.75$ → **reject down-set geometry claim**.

---

## CO-4: $`k`$-Criticality Shift (Independent Layer + Sham Control)

**Claim:** Critical dimension is $`k-1`$, where $k$ = number of independent layers. Adding a layer shifts RG-flow intercept by $`+1`$.

**Protocol:**

1. **Baseline:** Estimate intercept $\beta_0 = (k-1) - \alpha_0$ from $\Delta_t \log K$ regression on $(r, N)$
2. **Add independent layer:** Include a new ontology $X_{k+1}$ with $k_{\text{eff}} \to k_{\text{eff}} + 1$ (verified via rank test, Sec. 8.3)
3. **Add sham layer:** Duplicate existing layer $X_1'(t) = X_1(t) + \xi(t)$ with small noise; $k_{\text{eff}}$ unchanged

**Criteria:**

1. **Independent shift:** $\beta_0^{\text{new}} - \beta_0^{\text{baseline}} = 1 \pm 0.2$ (within 20% tolerance)
2. **Sham null:** $\beta_0^{\text{sham}} - \beta_0^{\text{baseline}} = 0 \pm 0.2$
3. **Statistical significance:** Both tested via $`F`$-test for intercept change, $p < 0.05$

**Failure mode:** Wrong shift magnitude or sham-layer shift $\neq 0$ → **reject** $k-1$ **criticality model**.

---

## CO-5: Cross-Ontology Penalty Sign Test

**Claim:** Mixing layers incurs a cost $`\alpha_{\text{XO}} \cdot c(\mathbf{p})`$; sign of $\alpha_{\text{XO}}$ pre-registered per domain.

**Criteria:**

1. **Pre-registration:** Before analysis, declare expected sign (positive, negative, or zero) based on domain knowledge
2. **Estimated sign:** $\widehat{\alpha}_{\text{XO}}$ from regression $\Delta_t \log K \sim r + N + c(\mathbf{p})$
3. **Agreement:** Observed sign matches pre-registered sign with $p < 0.05$ (one-sided test)
4. **Effect size:** $|\widehat{\alpha}_{\text{XO}}| / \text{SE} > 2$ (minimal strength requirement)

**Failure mode:** Sign flip → **falsification of domain model** (not COPL framework). Report as "cross-layer penalty not present or opposite direction."

---

## CO-6: Brittleness Ladder

**Claim:** Detuning sensitivity $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{p}}$ increases with order $r$ and support $`N`$.

**Criteria:**

1. **Order monotonicity:** Median $\mathcal{B}$ non-decreasing in $r$ (Mann-Kendall $`p < 0.05`$)
2. **Support monotonicity:** Median $\mathcal{B}$ non-decreasing in $N$ (Mann-Kendall $`p < 0.05`$)
3. **Pairwise Spearman:** $\rho(\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{p}}, r) > 0$ and $\rho(\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{p}}, N) > 0$ with $p < 0.05$

**Failure mode:** Decreasing trend or negative correlation → **reject brittleness-order coupling**.

---

## CO-7: Permutation Discipline (Circular-Block + Multiverse)

**Claim:** Discoveries are robust to temporal resampling and analyst choices.

**Criteria:**

1. **Circular-block permutation:** Use automatic block-length selection (Politis–White); generate $B = 1000$ null realizations preserving autocorrelation
2. **Max-T correction:** Emergent locks must survive FWER control (not just FDR) at $\alpha = 0.05$
3. **Multiverse analysis:** Run all $M$ pre-specified analysis branches (filter choices, pooling parameters, detuning functions); require **majority vote** (≥70% of branches) for each gate
4. **Pair-conserving shuffle:** For emergence scores, permute "composite vs pairwise" labels within support sets

**Failure mode:** If $< 70\%$ of multiverse branches pass, or if max-T fails → **reject robustness claim**.

---

## CO-8: Desync Collapse (Jitter Test)

**Claim:** Emergent locks are genuine phase-locking, not transient alignment artifacts.

**Criteria:**

1. **Common jitter stability:** $|\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}^{\text{jitter}} - \mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}^{\text{original}}| < 0.1 \cdot |\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}^{\text{original}}|$ under uniform window shifts (Sec. 7.4)
2. **Layer-specific jitter collapse:** $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}^{\text{indep-jitter}} \le 0.5 \cdot \mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}^{\text{original}}$ under independent layer jitters (graceful degradation, not preservation)
3. **Pre-registered tolerance:** Stability band $\sigma_{\text{tol}}$ determined from pilot data

**Failure mode:** Stable under independent jitters → **synchronization artifact**, not true phase lock.

---

## CO-9: RG-Time Placebo (Nonstationarity Control)

**Claim:** Positive RG-flow intercept is due to LOW mechanism, not frequency drift.

**Criteria:**

1. **Block-permute windows:** Scramble temporal order of analysis windows before applying $\mathcal{R}$
2. **Intercept null:** Estimated $\beta_0^{\text{scrambled}} \approx 0$ (within CI: $`|\beta_0^{\text{scrambled}}| < 0.5`$)
3. **Original positive:** $\beta_0^{\text{original}} > 1.0$ for $k \ge 3$ systems

**Failure mode:** Positive intercept persists under scrambling → **nonstationary confound**, not RG growth.

---

## CO-10: Rank Consistency (Effective Layer Test)

**Claim:** Declared $k$ matches functionally independent phase processes.

**Criteria:**

1. **Rank test:** $k_{\text{eff}} = k_{\text{declared}}$ from phase PCA (Sec. 8.3)
2. **Sham-layer null:** Adding duplicate layer yields intercept shift $\approx 0$ (tested in CO-4)
3. **Independent-layer shift:** Adding new source yields shift $\approx +1$ **only if** $k_{\text{eff}} \to k_{\text{eff}} + 1$

**Failure mode:** $k_{\text{eff}} < k_{\text{declared}}$ and claims proceed with wrong $k$ → **reject critical-dimension specification**.

---

## CO-11: Residual Survival (Latent-Clock Null)

**Claim:** Emergent locks are not driven by shared latent oscillator.

**Criteria:**

1. **Rank-1 template:** Fit $\widehat{\psi}(t)$ via Procrustes/Karcher mean (Sec. 8.2)
2. **Residual emergence:** $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}^{\perp} > 0$ after projecting out $\widehat{\psi}$
3. **Magnitude retention:** $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}^{\perp} \ge 0.5 \cdot \mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}$ (emergent structure not fully explained by common drive)

**Failure mode:** $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}^{\perp} \le 0$ → **common-drive confound**.

---

## CO-12: Harmonic Robustness

**Claim:** Emergent locks are not harmonic shadows of pairwise structure.

**Criteria:**

1. **Harmonic censoring:** Apply notch filters at $\{2f_i, 3f_i, \ldots, 5f_i\}$ for each dominant frequency $f_i$ (Sec. 8.4)
2. **Persistence:** $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{p}}^{\text{censored}} > 0$ after harmonic removal
3. **Pattern check:** $\mathbf{p} / \gcd(\mathbf{p})$ is **not** a harmonic pattern (e.g., $(1, -2, 1)$ flagged as 2nd-harmonic suspect)

**Failure mode:** Vanishes under censoring or matches harmonic pattern → classify as **harmonic shadow**, not emergent.
