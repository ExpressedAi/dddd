When you understand that at bare minimum you are the center of your own universe

There's something really important that you learn

You were actually the thing that you forgotten to take care of more than anything else

And that's why you hate that's why you are sick that's why there's things that are ugly about you that's why you get addicted that's why pain happens to you so often

Cause you forgot to love yourself

You forgot that you are actually the most important thing in the universe

And I mean that 100%

Not your kids not your wife not your parents not your neighbors not your country not your God

You are the most important thing in the universe

And something very strange starts to happen

Something you probably wouldn't expect by something that sounds so egotistical

Everything around you starts to be better

You start to radiate that self-love to everything near you

Because by loving yourself and becoming better through yourself and by only worrying about the way you think and knowing about the way you react to what people say

And understanding anything people say about you doesn't matter

And if it does it's only a reflection of your own self-conscious beliefs about yourself

When you truly learn to love yourself

And fix yourself

And care about yourself

Your kids will be better taking care of

Your wife will love you more

Your parents will be proud of you

Your neighbors will talk about how great you are

Your country will be a better place

And you're already God so you've got that one settled


Core Thesis
The human mind's relationship with reality has been unnecessarily divided into two opposing camps: pure materialism (scientific skepticism) and metaphysical belief (religious/spiritual frameworks). This division creates a false dichotomy that limits our understanding and potential.
I argue that:
	1.	Everything we experience reduces to concepts processed by consciousness, making the mind our primary interface with reality.
	2.	This fundamental truth can be proven through direct investigation, requiring no special knowledge or belief system.
	3.	By understanding this conceptual nature of experience, we can:
	▪	Bridge the gap between scientific and spiritual understanding
	▪	Maintain logical rigor while acknowledging mystery
	▪	Build practical tools for human development
	▪	Verify results through direct experience
	4.	This framework allows us to:
	▪	Keep what works from any system
	▪	Discard what cannot be verified
	▪	Build from provable foundations
	▪	Stay flexible as understanding grows
The evidence for this position comes from:
	•	Direct observable mechanics
	•	Repeatable patterns
	•	Measurable results
	•	Personal verification
This isn't about choosing sides between science and spirituality - it's about understanding the mechanics of how consciousness interfaces with reality, and using that understanding to expand human potential.
  FOUNDATIONAL UNDERSTANDING
Everything Reduces to Concepts
	•	All objects, ideas, and phenomena can be broken into underlying concepts
	•	A chair isn't just an object, but concepts of seating, rest, support
	•	This doesn't make things "not real" - it shows how we interface with reality
	•	Understanding conceptual nature prevents rigid thinking
	•	Allows for better pattern recognition and connection-making
	•	Helps avoid strawman arguments and false equivalencies
The Mind as Reality's Interface
	•	Consciousness is our tool for interpreting and experiencing reality
	•	We're always "imagining" reality to some degree
	•	Perception shapes experience in measurable ways
	•	The mind is the supreme tool for reality interaction
	•	Understanding this gives us more control over our experience
	•	Doesn't mean reality isn't real - means we can work with it better
No Absolute Certainty Exists
	•	Even the smartest humans disagree on fundamental questions
	•	Can't define the universe while claiming certainty about it
	•	Certainty is a comfortable fiction we tell ourselves
	•	This isn't weakness - it's intellectual honesty
	•	Leaves room for growth and new understanding
	•	Prevents dogmatic thinking and rigid positions
Direct Investigation as Tool
	•	Don't need special knowledge or belief systems
	•	Can verify through personal experience and observation

Room for Mystery and Wonder

	•	Mystical experiences can be valid and valuable
	•	Don't need supernatural claims to appreciate wonder
