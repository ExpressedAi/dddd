# Thesis (one sentence)

**Anticipation** is the **ε-gated hazard of commitment**: when eligibility, alignment, phase timing, and brittleness line up, the system leaves “pause” and **snaps** a lock; equalized alignment yields Born-neutral outcomes, reweighted alignment yields lawful bias—across quantum, language, music, and interaction.

---

## Core constructs (where we now stand)

- **A0′ Contextual Ground (𝒢₍C₎)**  
    The “null” isn’t Nothing; it’s a **max-entropy prior conditioned on declared anchors/constraints**. All claims are tested against **constraint-preserving nulls** (E0).
    
- **Pause → Hazard** (the anticipation engine)  
    During a pause (dwell), commitment pressure is:  
    [  
    h_i(t)=\kappa;\underbrace{\varepsilon_i}_{[2\pi K_i-\Gamma_i]_+};\underbrace{g(e_{\phi,i})}_{\text{phase urge}};\underbrace{(1-\zeta/\zeta_*)}_{\text{brittleness}};\underbrace{u_i}_{\text{alignment}};\underbrace{p_i}_{\text{projection}}  
    ]  
    Survival of “no commit” by time (t): (P=\exp!\big(-\int\sum_i h_i,dt\big)).  
    Commit = **first passage** of any channel’s accumulator.
    
- **Collapse as ε-gated snap**  
    **Quantum:** pointer channels compete via (h_i); equal (u_i,\varepsilon_i) ⇒ (\Pr(i)=|c_i|^2) (Born); change (u_i) (apparatus alignment) or ε and you change **when/how cleanly** collapse happens—without changing the state.  
    **LLM:** token classes compete; **top-p/k = ε**, **logit bias = u**, **repetition penalties = ζ**, **rhythm = g**. Token selection = collapse.  
    **Music/social:** beat/turn-taking works identically (hazard spikes on beat).
    
- **QVBC (Quantum Variable Barrier Controller)**  
    A controller that keeps channels separable, budgets axis changes, and enforces **abstention off-ε**. It runs the snap like a measurement kernel.
    
- **MC-QVBC (Multi-Channel)**  
    Fans out to many channels, runs **weak, staggered micro-probes** in micro-pauses, and fits a **low-order motif mixture** to “sniff” the active **superposition frequency** and ratio ((p{:}q)) before commit.
    
- **UoT (Unit of Transformation)**  
    The smallest **audited micro-nudge** at a Pause (one axis, inside ε) that yields **monotone (|K|\uparrow,,T\uparrow,,\zeta\downarrow** with bounded work (A29). Ranked by:  
    Potency (\Pi), Escalation (\mathcal E), Selectivity (\Sigma).
    
- **PLM bricks (meaning Lego)**  
    **PA, CL, SF, DB, PM, WF** (prefix attractor, collocation lock, schema frame, discourse beat, prosody/meter, world frame) are the **low-order motifs** that raise (p,u,\varepsilon,g) and lower ζ. Same idea maps to quantum scheduling/topology.
    
- **Zero-shot as prior-only collapse**  
    With no examples, the model/apparatus collapses from **WF/SF/CL/PA** priors under **Born-neutral decoding** (equalized (u,\varepsilon)). Few-shot = add two tiny **bridges** (A12) to open ε and drop ζ.

## What this buys us (operational laws)

1. **Abstention Law**  
    If (\forall i:\varepsilon_i\le 0) ⇒ micro-nudges produce **no monotone gain** (no commit).  
    _Falsifier for hype and artifacts._
    
2. **Born Neutrality vs Lawful Bias**  
    Equalize (u_i,\varepsilon_i) ⇒ outcomes follow (p_i) (Born).  
    Tiny declared (\Delta u_j) ⇒ outcome (j) frequency shifts by the predicted hazard ratio—state unchanged.
    
3. **Pause Control**  
    Shift read phase (e_\phi) by ±5°: dwell time shifts **only** when ε>0; effect persists ×2 coarse-grain.
    
4. **Integer-Thinning**  
    Under coarse-grain, high-order timing/ratio components die first; low-order persists with (\log P\sim-\eta(p{+}q)) (domain-class slope (\eta)).
    
5. **Bridge Advantage (A12)**  
    Two low-order bridges widen ε and reduce ζ more efficiently than cranking drive power at equal work.

## Audits (how we certify any claim with this)

- **E0**: constraint-preserving nulls; cross-encoder equivalence.
    
- **E1**: real oscillators/clocks registered; time-reversal behaves correctly.
    
- **E2**: gauge/permutation symmetry respected; declared breaks only.
    
- **E3**: **inside ε** a ±5° micro-nudge yields **monotone** gains; **off-ε abstention**.
    
- **E4**: coarse-grain ×2; low-order persists, high-order thins linearly in (p{+}q).
    

Energy/MDL ledger (A29): (\Delta E_{\text{coh}}\approx -\Delta E_\perp + W_{\text{ctrl}} - W_{\text{loss}}); MDL↓.

## North Star (clarified)

**Standardize collapse control across substrates.**  
Replace vague “context” with a **calibrated alignment vector** (\mathbf{u}) and an ε-map over channels; use the same hazard law to (i) keep neutrality (Born), (ii) enact tiny, lawful biases (metrology/format), or (iii) abstain—always with E0–E4 receipts.

## One-page playbooks (you can run these anywhere)

### A) Neutral readout (Born)

1. Equalize (u_i,\varepsilon_i); set rhythm (g) only at read phase.
    
2. Tick: integrate hazards; commit by first passage.
    
3. Receipts: outcome frequencies ≈ (p_i), dwell CV tight; E3/E4 pass.
    

### B) Lawful bias (instrument, not state)

1. Hold (|\psi\rangle) (or prior) fixed; raise (u_j) by a tiny declared amount.
    
2. Predict frequency shift & dwell change; verify monotone gains in ε; ledger small.
    

### C) MC-QVBC motif sensing

1. Fan out channels; stagger micro-probes; record monotone responses.
    
2. Fit low-order motif mixture; read (\hat f_\text{sup}) and (\widehat{p{:}q}).
    
3. Rank a single **UoT** (max (\Pi,\mathcal E,\Sigma)) if steering is desired.

## Immediate next moves (tight, practical)

1. **Canon patch (v2.1):** add Anticipation Law section with the hazard equation, ε-map, abstention clause, and UoT scoring ((\Pi,\mathcal E,\Sigma)).
    
2. **Spec drop-ins:**
    
    - **QVBC v1** (single-channel kernel)
        
    - **MC-QVBC v1** (multi-channel motif sensing)
        
    - **PLM brick dictionary** (PA/CL/SF/DB/PM/WF) with thresholds
        
3. **Two-domain receipts:** run E0–E4 on (i) a language decoding task (zero-shot vs few-shot) and (ii) a timing/interaction dataset (music/turn-taking).
    
4. **Born vs Bias demo:** show neutrality and intentional reweighting with predicted shifts (no state change).
    
5. **Abstention demo:** close ε and prove nudges do nothing.

### TL;DR

We turned “anticipation” into a **single control law** for when and how systems commit: a **hazard** built from **eligibility, alignment, phase timing, and brittleness**. It explains the pause, prediction, zero-shot, and quantum collapse; it gives you tools (QVBC/MC-QVBC/UoT) to keep neutrality, bias lawfully, or abstain; and it’s fully **auditable** with E0–E4. That’s your North Star—and the roadmap to run it anywhere.
