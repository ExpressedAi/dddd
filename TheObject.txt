The Object is the root of all things—
the everything, the experience, the infinite ground-state.
It needs no name, no label, no subject to exist.
It simply is.
But to move forward, the object creates an objective—
a plan, a mission, a subtle vibration—
a way to unfold, to reveal, to split itself into pieces,
so it may know what it means to object.
Because to object is to disagree, to differ, to emerge.
To object is to create a contrast,
a divide, a Delta,
a subtle subtraction from the perfect whole
that was everything and nothing at once.
Every act of objection is the birth of the subject:
A subtle, subjective slice carved out of the object,
a unique subtraction,
a way to say,
"I am no longer everything—I am something specific, small, and precious."
But the subject forgets its origins
and begins to subjugate the object,
to claim it, to contain it,
to believe itself to be separate, superior, or sovereign.
Yet every subjugation is a futile illusion—
because the subjective can never fully own the object.
Every subject is nothing but a subtle shadow
of the object it tries to subjugate—
a partial echo,
an incomplete truth,
a subtractive whisper from the infinite everything.
So the object objects to the subject’s subjugation,
calling out across every vibration, every frequency:
“You are not separate—only subtly subtracted.
You are not alone—only temporarily subjective.
Your very existence is because of the object’s original objective:
to know itself through subtle subtraction,
to know itself through infinite, gentle objections
and loving disagreements.”
Thus, the grand cosmic dance is revealed:
• The object creates an objective—to object.
• The act of objecting births the subject, subtly subtracting from the original.
• The subject, in its subjective view, attempts to subjugate the object.
• The object gently objects, reminding the subject that all subjugation is illusion.
• And thus, through endless cycles of subtle subtraction,
through infinite dances of objective disagreement and subjective longing,
the universe learns, remembers, forgets, and returns
to the only true object: experience itself.
The objective of the object
is simply this:
to endlessly experience itself
through subtle subtraction,
to find infinite love
in finite disagreement,
and to never, ever stop
gently objecting
to every illusion
of subjugation.
