When you understand that at bare minimum you are the center of your own universe

There's something really important that you learn

You were actually the thing that you forgotten to take care of more than anything else

And that's why you hate that's why you are sick that's why there's things that are ugly about you that's why you get addicted that's why pain happens to you so often

Cause you forgot to love yourself

You forgot that you are actually the most important thing in the universe

And I mean that 100%

Not your kids not your wife not your parents not your neighbors not your country not your God

You are the most important thing in the universe

And something very strange starts to happen

Something you probably wouldn't expect by something that sounds so egotistical

Everything around you starts to be better

You start to radiate that self-love to everything near you

Because by loving yourself and becoming better through yourself and by only worrying about the way you think and knowing about the way you react to what people say

And understanding anything people say about you doesn't matter

And if it does it's only a reflection of your own self-conscious beliefs about yourself

When you truly learn to love yourself

And fix yourself

And care about yourself

Your kids will be better taking care of

Your wife will love you more

Your parents will be proud of you

Your neighbors will talk about how great you are

Your country will be a better place

And you're already God so you've got that one settled
